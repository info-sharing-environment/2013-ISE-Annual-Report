  <h2><a href="#section-0" id="section-0">Appendix A &mdash; ISE Performance Data</a></h2>

  <p>This Report provides an executive-level summary of ISE
  activities over the previous year to illustrate the major focus areas and investments
  by ISE agencies, and provides a basis of performance analysis by the office of the
  PM-ISE. The following high-level analysis and findings provide:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p> An assessment of the extent to which this Report
  conforms to the requirements as stated in the law;</p></li>
  	<li><p> An assessment of the maturity of the ISE as measured by
  the ISE Annual Performance Assessment; and</p></li>
  	<li><p> Identification of gaps and opportunities for improvement
  to better inform future investments.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h3><a href="#section-0a" id="section-0a">High-Level Analysis
  	of the Annual ISE Performance Assessment Report</a></h3>

  <p>The ISE Performance Framework, detailed in Section 6
  of this Report, defines three stages of maturity to communicate expected capabilities
  for the following year.</p>

  <p><strong>Maturity Stage 1</strong> &mdash;  capabilities currently expected for ISE
  agencies;</p>

  <p><strong>Maturity Stage 2</strong> &mdash;  capabilities that are expected to be developed
  two to three years from baseline; and</p>

  <p><strong>Maturity Stage 3</strong> &mdash;  capabilities that are expected five to seven
  years from baseline.</p>

  <p>2013 is the first, full performance assessment year
  after the 2012 baseline year. Analysis in this Report focuses on Maturity Stage 1
  initiatives and capabilities, some of which are incorporated into National Strategy
  for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (National Strategy) implementation
  plans.<a href="#_ftn64" id="_ftnref64" title=""><sup>[64]</sup></a>Overall, the 2013 ISE
  Performance Assessment found no statistically significant<a href="#_ftn65" id="_ftnref65" title=""><sup>[65]</sup></a>
  increase in performance for Maturity Stage 1 initiatives and capabilities when
  compared to the 2012 baseline analysis.</p>

  <p>Early implementation planning for many of the 2013 performance
  focus areas was incorporated into the 16 priority objectives in the National
  Strategy, released in December 2012.<a href="#_ftn66" id="_ftnref66" title=""><sup>[66]</sup></a> The
  implementation roadmap, discussed previously in the Way Forward section, provides
  actions, milestones, and accountability leads that are aligned with the priority
  objectives in the National Strategy.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-0b" id="section-0b">Gaps, Challenges, and Opportunities</a></h3>

  <p>In the process of compiling this Report, and based on
  collaboration with ISE agencies, PM-ISE identified several additional gaps,
  challenges, and opportunities for improvement of the ISE.</p>

  <p>Significant findings on key issues from 2012 are compared in
  tables below with the findings from this year's assessment on like
  issues. The tables are aligned to the five goals in the National Strategy and
  identify areas that (1) were not meeting Maturity Stage 1 expectations as previously
  reported in 2012 compared with 2013 findings and mitigation activities,<a
  href="#_ftn67" id="_ftnref67" title=""><sup>[67]</sup></a> (2) are
  Maturity Stage 2 and 3 areas of assessment that are at risk, and (3) represent
  additional gaps, challenges, and opportunities for improvement for ISE.</p>

  <p>Most departments and agencies are meeting Maturity Stage 1
  expectations; however, there are underperforming areas which are identified in this
  report. 2014 will be the first execution year for Maturity Stage 2 initiatives, and
  ISE agencies are well positioned to meet the expected goals. Data from the 2013 ISE
  performance assessment suggest that some select Stage 2 and 3 issues require closer
  management oversight to meet forecasted expectations.</p>

  <p>Near-term actions to address these issues are reflected in the
  high-level implementation roadmap found in the Way Forward section of this Report.
  The roadmap includes implementation guidance from the PM-ISE to the agencies, based
  upon White House priorities for information sharing and safeguarding. PM-ISE and the
  ISA IPC will monitor ISE agency efforts to implement White House guidance through the
  governance and performance management processes outlined in Section 6 of this
  Report.</p>

  <p>As discussed in the body of this Report, the ISE Performance
  Framework allows the office of the PM-ISE to assess improvements to the
  nations' ability to detect, analyze, and respond to terrorism,
  WMD, and homeland security threats. ISE agency performance data is discussed
  throughout this Report. The framework for the assessment and the details of the data
  are described below.</p>

  <p>Seventy-five percent of the 2013 ISE PAQ
  (detailed later in this appendix) was constant from the 2012 questionnaire. The
  remaining questions were expanded to focus on newly identified gaps from the 2012
  assessment and new mission areas identified through strategic planning by federal
  governance bodies. Publishing the 2012 National Strategy in December of 2012, allowed
  for the 2013 ISE Performance Assessment to be explicitly aligned to its goals and
  sub-goals, giving the ISE a clear strategic footing for monitoring
  progress.</p>

  <p>Responses to the 2013 ISE PAQ are scored on a 0-1 scale; the
  aggregate scores for responses to questions within each capability area are
  calculated as a percentage of the total possible score.</p>

  <p>
  <img border="0" width="439" height="144" src="assets/img/image106.png" alt="Title: Overall 2013 ISE Performance by Goal and Capability Area - Description: Performance by goal in terms of community, process, and technology: drive collective action through collaboration and accountability; improving information discover and access through common standards; optimize mission effectiveness and interoperability; protect privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties through consistency and compliance."  /></p>
  <p><small>Figure 9. Overall 2013 ISE Performance by Goal and Capability Area</small></p>

  <p>The goals and sub‐goals are aligned to the Administration’s strategic guidance, priorities, and to
the required ISE attributes per IRTPA Section 1016(b)(2). Each ISE performance assessment
question is aligned to a specific subtopic, maturity stage, and to the capability areas of community,
process, and technology. These alignments allow PM-­‐ISE to use agency responses to the ISE PAQ to
determine ISE-­‐wide progress against both the Administration’s priorities and the attributes of the
ISE, while maturing community involvement, and process and technology adoption and use. As
2012 was a baseline year for PM‐ISE’s performance methodology and a year for finalizing the
National Strategy, responses to "Maturity Stage 1" questions remain the focus of this year’s
performance assessment and are highlighted.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-0c" id="section-0c">Trends from the 2012 ISE Performance Assessment
  	Questionnaire</a></h3>

  <p>Due to the planning efforts around the new National Strategy,
  there has been little change from the 2012 to the 2013 assessment responses on the
  whole. With agencies that have participated in both the 2012 and 2013 assessments,
  there were generally consistent overall response scores (or a very slightly positive
  overall trend), with a notable exception in the privacy area, where significant
  improvement was made.</p>

  <p>Agency responses are detailed below. For those questions
  carried over from the 2012 ISE PAQ, comparisons are provided detailing how the ISE
  departments and agencies changed year over year. In addition, agencies were requested
  to provide narrative examples of activity for all relevant questions and comments
  that further explain their response choice. Agency narratives that best represent the
  activities and trends in the ISE over the past year, both positive and negative,
  accompany each graphic to enrich the response data.</p>

  <p>The graphics below detail the trends from the 2012 to 2013
  responses where the same agencies answered in both years to show a direct comparison.
  The legend accompanying the graphics in the upper corner of the page describes that
  the inner pie chart displays the 2013 response while the staggered outer ring
  displays 2012 data. The colors represent the same response from each year. For
  example, the Yes-No questions are either designated by the color green
  ('Yes') or red
  ('No') for both the inner pie chart and outer
  ring. An outer ring will not be displayed for those questions only asked in 2013.</p>

  <p>The percentages depicted below are based on the total number
  of responding agencies for this question. For example, if only 15 out of the 16
  agencies responded to a "Yes/No" question and 10
  responded "Yes," the resulting percentage would be 67%
  (10 out of 15).</p>

  <p>The 2013 ISE PAQ population differed slightly from 2012. Army
  Intelligence, Marine Corps Intelligence, and the Defense Intelligence Agency
  responded to the 2012 ISE PAQ but did not submit responses to the 2013 ISE PAQ. In
  2012, the Federal Bureau of Investigation responded independently to the ISE PAQ, but
  its responses in 2013 were consolidated with the Department of Justice submission
  along with the Drug Enforcement Agency and the Bureau for Alcohol, Tobacco, and
  Firearms. In addition, the 2013 ISE PAQ allowed agency sub-components to answer and
  consolidate responses for agency scoring. The question by question analysis below
  shows all (sub-agency) responses, where applicable.</p>

  <p>Due to the assessment population differences, PM-ISE only
  performed trending analysis on the common respondents <em>and</em> questions between 2012 and 2013. It is for this reason that data cannot as a
  whole be directly compared between the 2012 and 2013 ISE Annual Reports.</p>

   <p><strong>DHS:</strong>
   Extensive - DHS' Office of Intelligence and Analysis
   (I&amp;A) is continually working to enhance intelligence support to and
   analytic collaboration with these partners. These efforts have included the
   facilitation and development of joint analytic products produced with fusion
   centers, leveraging State, Local, Tribal, and Territorial (SLTT) subject
   matter expertise through a variety of fellowships and analytical exchanges,
   soliciting SLTT input to capture and validate intelligence and information
   needs, and leveraging SLTT feedback to tailor I&amp;A products and services
   to better serve our field partners. DHS also heavily leverages the fusion
   centers to incorporate SLTT information and perspectives into national-level
   intelligence community assessments pertaining to, for example, southwest
   border violence, threats, and Mexican cartel influence over U.S.-based gangs.
   Additionally, over a dozen DHS intelligence reports were cited as sources in the upcoming
   version of the National Intelligence Estimate titled
   "Terrorist Threats to the U.S. Homeland to
   2016." To provide a state and local perspective on the terrorist
   threat nationwide for this assessment, DHS also received responses from
   numerous fusions centers from across the country which ranked the threat
   actors they view as the most concerning in their jurisdictions. To further
   expand on these efforts DHS I&amp;A recently stood up the Field Analytic
   Support Taskforce (FAST). FAST advocates for fusion center intelligence
   requirements and collaborates with analysts from across
   I&amp;A's Analysis Directorate and federal interagency
   partners to identify, develop, and share intelligence products with SLTT
   partners. Key to this effort is the management and sponsorship joint analysis
   and production efforts with fusion centers. DHS has recognized that the best
   way to integrate fusion center information into I&amp;A products is to
   produce products jointly with SLTT analysts. To that end, dozens of products
   across I&amp;A's Analysis and Production Directorate that
   have been produced on everything from border security issues and major
   special events to suspicious activity reporting (SAR). SAR has been a key
   SLTT data set that DHS I&amp;A analysts have leveraged for producing products
   that highlight emerging tactics may provide clarity to trends or patterns in
   pre-operational terrorist activity.</p>

   <p><strong>DOT:</strong> Little - In 2011
   DOT's Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) worked closely
   with Fusion Centers as it developed and distributed a publication entitled,
   "Information-sharing Guidebook for Transportation
   Management Centers, Emergency Operations Centers, and Fusion
   Centers." The guidebook provides an overview of the common
   mission and functions of transportation management centers, emergency
   operations centers, and fusion centers, and focuses on the types of
   information these centers produce and manage, and how the sharing of such
   information among the centers can be beneficial during both day-to-day
   operations and during incidents.</p>

   - The FBI requires all employees to complete annual training requirements

   measured by employees completing mandated training and being held accountable
   for all aspects of content in the performance of their duties. In the WMDD
   realm, these trainings have better prepared individuals in handling any type
   of CBRN threat or incident. The WMDD has also certified approximately 30 WMD
   Coordinators to date. During 2012, the FBI's VA received
   up to 14,000 individual hits a month&mdash;nearly half of the
   Bureau employee workforce. During 2012, approximately 40,000 readers signed
   up for e-mail alerts to notify them about upcoming content on the LEB
   website. The training courses offered by CTD have educated Agents, Analysts,
   Task Force Officers, and the FBI's federal/state/local law
   enforcement partners about current domestic and international terrorist
   groups' ideologies, techniques, and threat levels. This
   ongoing exchange of information and knowledge continues to serve as a vital
   link in the FBI's ability to prevent and deter terrorist
   attacks against the United States and its citizens. The training educates our
   partners about federal laws, policies, and procedures to ensure that our
   partners have the requisite knowledge, training and tools needed to work with
   FBI Agents to infiltrate domestic and international terrorist organizations,
   thwart impending attacks, and obtain justice against those who participate in
   attacks against the United States. The training has produced a high degree of
   success, as evidenced by the efficient and appropriate information-sharing
   that occurred following the Boston Marathon bombing. Federal, State and local
   authorities were collocated at various facilities; further investigation into
   protocols confirmed that 'lessons

  Test scenarios are used to demonstrate
  information sharing capabilities in a mission context; the use of test scenarios
  allows the enterprise to determine if the ISE is achieving its desired capabilities.
  PM-ISE also encourages agencies to create scenarios independently and has provided a
  "cookbook" to assist with agency development of a
  complete performance framework. Additional information for developing scenarios was
  provided to agencies on the ISE Blog.<a href="#_ftn75" id="_ftnref75" title=""><sup>[75]</sup></a> These
  resources allow agencies to possess and develop their own compatible performance
  frameworks to further capabilities in key ISE mission areas. These integrated
  performance frameworks, with line-of-sight from program to agency to ISE-level metric
  tracking, help guide ISE performance management, which will expand as the ISE
  collectively matures. The annual ISE Performance Assessment Questionnaire assesses
  ISE-level functions that enable the delivery of mission services and capabilities
  against a spectrum of maturity.</p>

  <p>Test scenarios remain a key component of the ISE
  Performance Framework, as they reflect the mission impacts of responsible information
  sharing to the ISE community of operators, investigators, and analysts.</p>

  <p>Last year's report references the
  ten test scenarios developed in 2011. This year, six of those scenarios are used to
  assess the progress of the ISE with respect to information sharing capabilities in
  specific high-value mission areas:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p> Improving role-based access to ISE-suspicious activity
  reports (SAR) and underlying case file content&mdash;implementation of
  privacy policy automation (1)</p></li>
  	<li><p> Improved law enforcement maritime response to a
  weapon-of-mass-destruction threat by enhancing first responders'
  situational awareness (2)</p></li>
  	<li><p> Improving cross-domain access to distributed information
  through federated search (3)</p></li>
  	<li><p> Removing impediments to federal acquisition and enabling
  out-of-the-box future interoperability through standards (4)</p></li>
  	<li><p> Using machine generated SARs to aid detection of threats
  to critical infrastructure and key resources (CIKR) (7)</p></li>
  	<li><p> Using the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) as
  an enabler to share international counterterrorism data on gang-related activity for
  watchlisting and screening (8)</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <p>These test scenarios illustrate government
  response to a public safety, law enforcement, counterterrorism, or homeland security
  situation over three time horizons; now, two to three years in the future, and five
  to seven years in the future. Each response demonstrates the
  analysts', operators', and
  investigators' improved ability to execute their mission
  objectives based on investments in information sharing. The remaining four scenarios
  are used by the office of the PM-ISE to shape conversations around the definitions
  for future capabilities within shared mission areas among ISE agencies. These
  scenarios are:</p>
  
  <ul>
  	<li><p> Enabling event deconfliction through common standards to
  promote officer safety (5)</p></li>
  	<li><p> Incentivizing information sharing of insider threat
  information within agencies and throughout government (6)</p></li>
  	<li><p> International humanitarian aid and disaster relief
  coordination efforts (9)</p></li>
  	<li><p> Improving public health response to biological threats
  with increased information to first responders (10)</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>With agency participation, PM-ISE staff crafted
  an additional scenario driven by National Security Staff and Office of Management and
  Budget (OMB) priorities. With cybersecurity being one of the primary focus areas for
  this Administration, addressing challenges in information sharing among federal cyber
  centers, as well as with state and local partners, is a key element to improving our
  nations' security.</p>

  <ul>
  	<li>
  		<p> Driving enhanced shared situational awareness for cyber
  		threat information among federal partners and fusion centers (11)</p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <p>The following graphics represent the six scenarios used
  to assess ISE progress based on the results of the 2013 performance assessment
  questionnaire, followed by the four used to define future capabilities, and the
  newest scenario referencing cybersecurity.</p>

  <p>Employees at an insurance company have noticed

   	through Common Standards to Promote Officer Safety</a></h3>
  

  <h4><a href="#section-1n" id="section-1n">Situation</a></h4>

  <p>Law enforcement agencies use an intranet-based Officer Safety
  Event Deconfliction System to store and maintain data on planned law enforcement
  events. Often, investigative efforts such as undercover operations, arrests, raids
  and other high risk situations create the potential for conflict between federal,
  state, local and tribal law enforcement agencies. They unknowingly work in close
  proximity to each other or may be coordinating an event on the same suspect at the
  same time. Federal law enforcement officers from Agency X are planning a raid on a
  home where it is believed a group of suspected drug traffickers are in possession of
  a large amount of illegal drugs.</p>

   	Data on Gang-related Activity for Watchlisting and Screening</a></h3>
  

  <h4><a href="#section-1w" id="section-1w">Situation</a></h4>

  <p>Gang-related activities are prevalent near border regions of
  the United States. Drug trafficking, human trafficking, smuggling, and other serious
  crimes by gangs are often used by terrorist organizations as a means to finance their
  activities. Governments on both sides of the border are increasing their focus on
  gang-related activity, not only to reduce crime, but to stem funds destined for
  terrorist groups. While analyzing stolen vehicle trends, a tactical intelligence
  analyst from border state Fusion Center X notices that there is a very low recovery
  rate of stolen automobiles. A tactical intelligence analyst at state Fusion Center Y
  is analyzing trends of stolen automobiles and notices that there is little to no
  information on a significant portion of these vehicles, making him think they may no
  longer be in the United States.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1F" id="section-1F">Situation</a></h4>

  <p>Cyberspace is a growing avenue for
  threats&mdash;including terrorism-related threats&mdash;to
  the national security of the United States. Media reports on the Stuxnet and Flame
  viruses have highlighted the capability of cyber-based attacks on critical
  infrastructure to result in physical damage. This and other nearly daily revelations
  have raised public concerns regarding the vulnerability of U.S. critical
  infrastructure. A key mitigation for these cyber-based threats is the ability to
  securely share sensitive and classified cyber threat and incident information

  <h2><a href="#section-2" id="section-2">Appendix C &mdash; ISE Investments</a></h2>

  <p>Partner agencies continue to make strategic information
  technology (IT) investments. Investment data captured via OMB's
  Exhibit 53 reporting provides a means to examine overall IT spending across the
  Federal Government as well as agency-level IT spending. It also provides visibility
  into IT investments aligned with strategic information sharing.</p>

  <p>At the Federal Government‐level, IT spending aligned with one or more ISE priorities remained
consistent with FY 2011 spending at approximately 14%. Figure C-­‐1 depicts the percentage of IT
budgets aligned with at least one of the ISE priorities broken out by agency and presents a
comparison between last and this year’s ISE‐aligned IT investments. The Department of Homeland
Security (DHS), Department of Justice (DOJ), and the Department of Interior (DOI) are the
agencies with the largest percentage of IT spending aligned with ISE priorities, which is also
consistent with last year’s reporting.</p>
<p>While this rank ordering remains nearly unchanged from last year’s reporting, there are changes
within individual agencies. For example, compared to last year, the Department of Defense (DoD)
increased its ISE‐aligned IT investment by 2.5%, DHS by 2.0%, and DOJ by 3.7% representing the
largest increase within an agency.</p><p><img border="0" width="397" height="235" src="assets/img/image374.png" alt="Title: Figure C-1 - Description: Agency IT Portfolio Aligned to ISE Priority Areas (year to year comparison)"  /></p>

  <p><small>Figure C-1. Agency IT Portfolios Aligned to ISE Priority Areas (year to year comparison)</small></p>
  <p>Similar to last year’s reporting, three quarters of IT investments aligned to ISE priority areas
directly supported agency‐specific missions, indicating that agencies remain focused on
supporting their respective mission objectives that further the value of information sharing and
safeguarding. Figure C‐2 depicts this along with other allocations.</p>
  <p><img border="0" width="397" height="174" src="assets/img/image376.png" alt="Title: Figure C-2 - Description: ISE-IT Investment Alignment to Parts of the Exhibit 53"  /></p>

  <p><small>Figure C-2. ISE IT Investment Alignment to Parts of the Exhibit 53</small></p>
  <p>The Exhibit 53 reporting allowed for an examination and analysis of federal IT spending alignment
to the ISE priority areas focused around the primary lines of business (LOB) within the Federal
Enterprise Architecture Business Reference Model (FEA BRM).</p>
<p>As highlighted in Figure C‐3 below, the FEA BRM IT Infrastructure Maintenance LOB accounted for
over one‐third (35%) of IT investments. The analysis also showed significant primary mapping to
other mission LOBs such as Access to Care (6%); Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance
(6%); Border and Transportation Security (6%); Criminal Investigation and Surveillance (5%); and,
another health‐related LOB, Health Care Delivery Services (3%). Combined, the five health‐related
LOBs comprised over 10% of total ISE priority‐related IT spending. Healthcare IT expenditures
aligned to ISE‐related priorities are dominated by Health and Human Services (HHS) and the DoD
and are mostly related to their efforts with electronic healthcare records systems and information
systems supporting the delivery of care.</p>
  <p><img border="0" width="399" height="216" src="assets/img/image378.png" alt="Title: Figure C-3 - Description: ISE IT Investment Alignment &mdash; FEA Mapping pie chart."  /></p>

  <p><small>Figure C-3. ISE IT Investment Alignment – FEA Mapping</small></p>
  <p>Through OMB’s Exhibit 53, federal agencies continue to report on and the office of the PM‐ISE
conducts analysis of ISE‐related IT spending. Year‐to‐year comparisons provide insight to data
consistency, evolving priorities, and overall trends. Going forward, PM‐ISE will continue to work
with OMB during subsequent reporting cycles to maintain data quality and data relevancy. PM‐ISE
will also continue to support innovative opportunities to further responsible information sharing
and safeguarding.</p>

  75% of the questions in the 2013 Performance Assessment Questionnaire (PAQ) were
  constant from the 2012 questionnaire. The remaining 25% of questions were expanded
  to focus on newly identified gaps from the 2012 assessment and new mission areas
  identified through strategic planning by federal governance bodies. Publishing the
  2012 National Strategy in December of 2012 allowed for the 2013 ISE Performance

  It is unclear what caused the decline&mdash;one possible explanation
  is that specific incentives for information sharing are less likely to be awarded
  as information sharing and collaboration are gradually becoming key components of
  job functions, especially those jobs that require interagency collaboration. This
  supposition is supported by the increase in employee information sharing
  performance objectives and the fact that 71% of agencies, up from 62% last year,
  report that they offer mission-specific training that supports information sharing
  and collaboration. Although there is no supporting data, it is also possible that
  the current fiscal environment has made it necessary to cut back on monetary
  awards. Further analysis is being done to understand these results.</p>
