  <h1><a href="#section-0" id="section-0">Executive Summary</a></h1>
  <h2><a href="#section-1" id="section-1">Organization</a></h2>
<p>The first five sections of the 2013 report are aligned with the five goals outlined in the President's National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (National Strategy), which was released in December 2012.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Collective Action through Collaboration and Accountability</strong> &mdash; Maturing of foundational ISE mission processes, and new and emerging information sharing initiatives.</li>
	<li><strong>Information Discovery and Access through Common Standards</strong> &mdash; Progress of ongoing efforts and new initiatives in the areas of information discovery and access. Fundamental elements of discovery and access.</li>
	<li><strong>Optimizing Mission Effectiveness through Shared Services and Interoperability</strong> &mdash; ISE initiatives focused on sharing services and achieving interoperability across networks and security fabrics to enable efficiency, reduce duplication, and improve mission success.</li>
	<li><strong>Strengthening the Safeguarding of Information</strong> &mdash; Key achievements in safeguarding capabilities that most directly relate to the advancement of information sharing, and specifically to the relevant characteristics of the ISE.</li>
	<li><strong>Protecting Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties</strong> &mdash; ISE initiatives focused on ensuring the protection of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties (P/CR/CL) through the consistent, government-wide application of protections.</li>
</ul>
<p>The final two sections address the ongoing implementation of the Information Sharing Environment (ISE).</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Managing and Fostering a Culture of Responsible Information Sharing</strong> &mdash; Progress on oversight and management functions that support information sharing and safeguarding.</li>
	<li><strong>Way Forward</strong> &mdash; A discussion of the Program Manager, Information Sharing Environment's (PM-ISE) management tools, performance framework, and annual planning cycle, and the implementation roadmap and actions in place to achieve ISE mission objectives.</li>
</ul>
<p>As required by the Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act of 2004 (IRTPA), this Annual Report provides an assessment of progress achieved in implementing the ISE. To that end, each section provides a summary of major accomplishments made, and also points out existing gaps, ongoing challenges, and opportunities for additional improvements.</p>
<h2><a href="#section-2" id="section-2">Collective Action Through Collaboration and Accountability</a></h2>
<p>Foundational ISE mission processes&mdash;including progress made in existing information sharing procedures between the Federal Government, and state, local, tribal, territorial, private-sector, and foreign partners&mdash;continued to mature during the past year. And new and emerging information sharing activities and initiatives that promote collaboration across the ISE have taken hold in both traditional counterterrorism (CT) and homeland security missions.</p>
<p>Significant accomplishments during this reporting period include the Administration's release of three national-level policy directives<a id="_ftnref1" href="#_ftn1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> that reinforce the importance of information sharing with critical infrastructure owners and operators. The National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), and the Federal Bureau of Investigations (FBI) continued to improve interagency collaboration with the establishment of the Joint Counterterrorism Assessment Team (JCAT), which replaced the Interagency Threat Assessment and Coordination Group (ITACG). Also, the International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the office of the PM-ISE began work on sponsoring a Unified Message Task Team (UMTT) to enhance Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) training, metrics, and policies.</p>
<p>Challenges and opportunities for improvement remain. In spite of the progress noted, work will continue to address the challenges to information sharing between the Federal Government and private-sector owner/operators of critical infrastructure. Also, the PM-ISE released a report in March 2013, <em>Improving Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Analysis</em>, and is working with the Information Sharing and Access Interagency Policy Committee (ISA IPC) SAR Subcommittee to address the findings and recommend mitigation strategies.</p>
<p>As noted in last year's report, gaps in tribal information sharing continue to be a concern. PM-ISE and partners across the ISE have identified some of the causes that hinder tribal information sharing and have written a white paper making the business case for improvement with recommendations for next steps. We are working together with agencies, state and local partners, and Tribes to develop specific plans.</p>
<p>The way forward includes continued focus on expanding the Nationwide SAR Initiative (NSI), as well as on adopting common-exchange processes for Requests for Information (RFIs) and for Alerts, Warnings, and Notifications (AWN).</p>
<h2><a href="#section-3" id="section-3">Information Discovery and Access Through Common Standards</a></h2>
<p>The National Strategy distinctly defines <em>discovery</em> and <em>access</em> as two separate concepts. <em>Discovery</em> addresses a user's ability to identify the existence of information, while <em>access</em> relates to the user's ability to retrieve information. Work by ISE mission partners and the office of the PM-ISE on fundamental elements of discovery and access includes: data-level tagging; data aggregation; the development and incorporation of interoperable industry-accepted technical standards for information sharing solutions; and standards-based acquisition.</p>
<p>Major accomplishments toward promoting discovery and access through common standards have been noted across the Federal Government. This year DHS launched the <em>Enhanced Overstay Vetting and Biographic Exit Project</em>, which seeks to increase DHS's capability for identifying immigration violators and prioritizing enforcement. The FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS) Division expanded the capabilities of the Law Enforcement National Data Exchange (N-DEx) in order to accommodate more records and users, and began sharing its investigative reports in near real-time with its criminal justice partners via N-DEx. And the Department of Defense (DoD) took a major step forward in promoting common standards with their decision to adopt the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) as the best option for department-wide, standards-based data exchanges.</p>
<p>The challenges to enterprise data correlation noted in last year's report continue to persist and to define the way ahead on the implementation roadmap. Development of a data-aggregation architecture is a priority objective of the National Strategy. Other objectives are adopting metadata standards to facilitate discovery, access, and monitoring across networks and security domains; and defining and implementing common standards to support automated discovery and access. And, while only about 50% of ISE agencies consider ISE functional and technical standards when issuing grants or Requests For Proposals (RFPs) for ISE-related systems, PM-ISE is working with the General Services Administration (GSA) to leverage National Strategy implementation actions to accelerate the use of information sharing standards in acquisition decisions.</p>
<h2><a href="#section-4" id="section-4">Optimizing Mission Effectiveness Through Shared Services and Interoperability</a></h2>
<p>ISE initiatives continue to focus on shared services and achieving interoperability across networks and security fabrics to enable efficiency, reduce duplication, and improve mission success. Integral to achieving interoperability is the development of an ISE Interoperability Framework that seeks to align reference architectures&mdash;like those for data aggregation and geospatial information&mdash;across the ISE. Interoperability is also realized through the adoption and implementation of standard identity and access management (IdAM) practices.</p>
<p>The ISA IPC's Data Aggregation Working Group (DAWG) continues to make progress in developing a reference architecture framework to assist departments and agencies in developing interagency data-sharing requirements. The GSA Federal Identity, Credential and Access Management (FICAM) Program Office is leading the implementation of the FICAM Roadmap across all security domains, which will further interoperability. And the office of the PM-ISE is coordinating an interagency effort with DHS, the Department of Interior (DOI), the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA), and the Department of Commerce (DOC) to develop a Geospatial Interoperability Reference Architecture (GIRA) in order to foster the reuse of geospatial services, reduce their information technology (IT) investment costs, and promote information sharing.</p>
<p>Opportunities to optimize mission effectiveness in the way forward include the development of an ISE interoperability framework (I<sup>2</sup>F), which the office of the PM-ISE began developing for the purpose of aligning enterprise architecture frameworks used by ISE partners to advance interoperability. Additional opportunities to improve federated identity management continue as PM-ISE and GSA develop an initial test scenario in which an ISE mission partner will use a Backend Attribute Exchange (BAE) to allow the transfer of data as users from one organization login to research cases, intelligence, or other information "owned and protected" by another organization.</p>
<p>Finally, many of the current federal IT budget models do not allow for flexibility, pooling, and extending the availability of funding. Support for removing limits on transferring funding across appropriations and agencies will better allow for provisioning common administrative IT services.</p>
<h2><a href="#section-5" id="section-5">Strengthening the Safeguarding of Information</a></h2>
<p>Protecting and sharing national security and counterterrorism-related information that is stored on&mdash;and disseminated electronically from&mdash;Federal Government information systems is of increasingly critical importance in ensuring the safety and security of the United States, and of the American people. Sharing and safeguarding information requires enforcement of the controls that are necessary in order to protect sensitive and classified information&mdash;as well as the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of individuals. At the same time, providing efficient access to mission-critical information is needed in order to enable analysts, operators, and investigators to effectively perform their jobs.</p>
<p>In November 2012, the Administration disseminated a <em>Presidential Memorandum on the National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs</em> in order to provide direction and guidance to help promote the development of effective insider threat programs within departments and agencies. These documents are meant to deter, detect, and prevent actions by employees who may represent a threat to national security.</p>
<p>During this reporting period DHS also expanded its Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) program, in accordance with Executive Order (EO) 13636 Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity, in order to better assist critical infrastructure owners and operators to improve protection of their systems from unauthorized access, exploitation, or data exfiltrations. DoD is also rolling out a program that will allow users of mobile device&mdash;working anywhere in the world, from remote battlefields to the Pentagon&mdash;to rapidly and securely share classified information and protected data across all components.</p>
<p>Recent breaches of security and disclosures of classified information highlight the vulnerabilities inherent in the protection of sensitive and classified information. Continued implementation of structural reform and standardized policies will help strengthen oversight as well as align information security best practices.</p>
<p>The work that began under EO 13587 Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information, designed to make substantive improvements to the security of our classified networks, is ongoing. The Senior Information Sharing and Safeguarding Steering Committee (Steering Committee) has mapped out goals for the way forward, and a plan for measuring progress with classified information sharing and safeguarding.</p>
<h2><a href="#section-6" id="section-6">Protecting Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties</a></h2>
<p>ISE initiatives focus on ensuring the protection of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties (P/CR/CL) through consistent, government-wide application of protections. This year, several agencies have written and adopted privacy policies that are at least as comprehensive as the ISE guidelines. Still, evolving threats and capabilities require that departments and agencies remain vigilant in including P/CR/CL protections in their decisions and that they incorporate effective ways to measure compliance with privacy policies.</p>
<p>The ISA IPC Privacy and Civil Liberties (P/CL) Subcommittee is developing guidelines for information sharing and safeguarding agreements that will both ensure that mission needs are met, and ensure the protection of P/CR/CL. DHS has established a formal process for conducting compliance reviews for the implementation of DHS-wide P/CR/CL protections. And this year PM-ISE hosted its fourth roundtable outreach event with the P/CR/CL advocacy community in order to build stronger protections in operational programs, training, and guidance materials.</p>
<p>While there have been initiatives to measure and ensure privacy compliance, there currently is not an effective ISE-wide performance measurement for internal agency compliance, oversight, and accountability mechanisms to ensure that P/CR/CL protections are being applied consistently. The development of these measures is a priority for the ISA IPC P/CL Subcommittee.</p>
<p>P/CR/CL objectives in the way forward include continued focus on issuing Fusion Center, SAR, and federal P/CR/CL policy guidelines.</p>
<h2><a href="#section-7" id="section-7">Managing and Fostering a Culture of Responsible Information Sharing</a></h2>
<p>Key to the implementation of the ISE are oversight and management functions that support information sharing and safeguarding&mdash;including the alignment and harmonization of governance bodies; performance management; training; and information sharing and safeguarding incentives within the ISE. The National Strategy provides a strategic vision and direction for ISE governance&mdash;a culture that values responsible information sharing to ensure mission success.</p>
<h2><a href="#section-8" id="section-8">Way Forward</a></h2>
<p>The ISE performance framework consists of a coherent set of management processes that align policy, governance, programmatic guidance, performance, standards, technologies, and architectures. The White House's programmatic guidance, PM-ISE's implementation guidance, and the annual ISE performance assessment make up the ISE performance framework and drive an annual planning and performance measurement cycle which informs ISE agency investments in responsible information sharing initiatives. The performance framework measures progress against milestones and objectives, and is presented in the form of an Implementation Roadmap.</p>

  <h1><a href="#section-9" id="section-9">Boston &mdash; Patriots' Day 2013</a></h1>
  <p>Monday, April 15, 2013 &mdash; Patriots' Day. The Boston Marathon started as planned: on schedule, and with great excitement. But at 2:49 pm EDT, about two hours after the winner completed the race, two bombs were detonated on Boylston Street, just before the finish line.</p>
<p>Ongoing investigations will determine the extent of any information sharing gaps that may have existed prior to the bombings. Any success by terrorists is a cause for grave concern. In analyzing what happened in Boston on Patriots' Day, we can also recognize and appreciate the enhanced information sharing capabilities among federal, state, and local law enforcement, intelligence, and public safety agencies that have been mobilized since 9/11. These capabilities were in place and operational in Boston prior to the bombings.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>"The Federal Government provided invaluable assistance both in helping us prepare for and respond to this tragic event. Preparedness training provided through federal funding set a framework for multiple jurisdictions to work seamlessly with one another in a highly effective manner."<a id="_ftnref2" href="#_ftn2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote> 
<p>For example, the Multi_Agency Coordination Center (MACC) was operational in the State's Emergency Operations Center prior to the start of the marathon. Representatives from Boston's police, fire, and emergency medical services, as well as public safety personnel from seven other cities and towns along the 26.2 mile marathon course were present in the MACC. Also included were representatives from state and federal agencies, including the FBI, DHS, the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), and the Coast Guard.</p>
<blockquote>
	<p>"...what I saw in action in Massachusetts was effective leadership, true collaboration, and trusting partnerships. This gave [Boston], the surrounding area, and the country, the confidence that law enforcement was working together and using everything at their disposal to bring this incident to a swift close."<a id="_ftnref3" href="#_ftn3"><sup>[3]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote> 
<p>In the days after the attack, Boston's designated fusion center, the Boston Regional Intelligence Center (BRIC), the Massachusetts Commonwealth Fusion Center, and fusion centers across the country tirelessly supported the Boston investigation. And the National Network of Fusion Centers supported requests for information (RFIs) to enhance the BRIC's support of the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force (JTTF).<a id="_ftnref4" href="#_ftn4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p> 
<blockquote>
	<p>"...we have seen an extraordinary effort by law enforcement, intelligence, and public safety agencies."<a id="_ftnref5" href="#_ftn5"><sup>[5]</sup></a></p>
</blockquote> 
<p>While collaboration among federal, state, and local agencies leading up to and after the Boston bombings certainly illustrates progress in implementation of the information sharing environment since 9/11, the event also painfully reinforces our need to continue advancing the goals of the National Strategy and our responsible information sharing capabilities.</p>
