  <h1><a href="#section-0" id="section-0">The Way Forward</a></h1>

  <p>The security of the Nation hinges on the ability to affect
  "... collaboration across the Federal
  Government&mdash;and with our state, local, tribal, private-sector, and
  international partners ..."<a href="#_ftn59" id="_ftnref59" title=""><sup>[59]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In December 2012 the President issued the National Strategy
  for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (National Strategy), which provides a
  roadmap for a broader collective effort of responsible sharing and safeguarding of
  national security information, while reaffirming existing ISE policies and
  strategies. The National Strategy has established principles, goals, and a set of
  priority objectives that create a vision and a way forward for the ISE.</p>

  <p>On behalf of the President, PM-ISE plans for and monitors the
  implementation of the ISE<a href="#_ftn60" id="_ftnref60" title=""><sup>[60]</sup></a> under
  the broad framework and vision of both the 2012 National Strategy and the 2007
  National Strategy for Information Sharing and Executive Orders 13388, <em>Furthering
  Strengthening the Sharing of Terrorism Information to Protect Americans</em>
  and 13587, <em>Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of
  Classified Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified
  Networks</em>. With the release of EO 13636, <em>Improving
  Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity</em>, and PPD-21,
  <em>Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience</em>, PM-ISE is
  engaged with the National Security Staff and agencies to develop plans to extend ISE
  management frameworks and activities to also support effective federal progress with
  cybersecurity information sharing.</p>

  <p>As described throughout this Report, significant progress has
  been made over the year implementing ISE capabilities, by advancing responsible
  information sharing, improving decisionmaking, and promoting partnerships. This
  section builds on last year's Way Forward and is informed by both
  qualitative and quantitative assessments of that progress, performance, and
  challenges over the past year.</p>

  <p>Under the ISA IPC, co-led by PM-ISE and the National Security
  Staff, a government-wide effort is underway to prioritize, plan, and coordinate
  continued, agency-based implementation of the ISE via a focus on the priority
  objectives of the National Strategy. Working in coordination with NSS, PM-ISE has set
  clear, unified and integrated priorities that span across the policy framework
  described above. PM-ISE priorities are described later in this section.</p>

  <p>Overall, PM-ISE has embraced the new tasks and the larger
  scope of the ISE while addressing the U.S. Government Accountability
  Office's (GAO) concerns, as outlined in GAO's
  Terrorism-Related Information Sharing High Risk List.<a href="#_ftn61" id="_ftnref61" title=""><sup>[61]</sup></a></p>

  <h2><a href="#section-1" id="section-1">Managing
  	Implementation of Responsible Information Sharing</a></h2>

  <h3><a href="#section-1a" id="section-1a">Institutionalizing a Management Framework</a></h3>

  <p>The National Strategy, supported with White House Programmatic
  Guidance, has updated the vision for the ISE. Both are rooted in the requirements of
  Intelligence Reform and Terrorism Prevention Act (IRTPA). Together they form the core
  drivers of PM-ISE's annual capability-focused Implementation
  Guidance. The PM-ISE Implementation Guidance is developed in partnership with the
  agency-based stewards of the National Strategy's 16 priority
  objectives, and provides the basis for a system-wide set of milestones and timelines
  for the following year, as required by IRTPA.<a href="#_ftn62" id="_ftnref62" title=""><sup>[62]</sup></a> Overall, the annual
  planning cycle helps move agencies closer to the target vision of national security
  through responsible information sharing.</p>

  <p><small>Figure 7. ISE Annual Planning Cycle.</small></p>
  <h3><a href="#section-1b" id="section-1b">Accountability and Commitment by Federal Departments and Agencies</a></h3>
  <p>The PM‐ISE Implementation Guidance outlines the actions assigned to specific federal agencies,
articulates the desired milestones and timelines, and identifies the sequenced requirements
needed to improve responsible information sharing and safeguarding for targeted capabilities,
programs, systems, and initiatives. Annual performance assessments measured against this
guidance provide accountability for progress over time, enabling leadership to make informed
programmatic and budget decisions in subsequent years. The status of completed and incomplete
Implementation Guidance actions can be found in Table 2 in Section 6 of this report.</p>
<p>Agencies lead the delivery, operation, and use of the ISE, and are accountable to the White House
for the goals and actions identified in programmatic and ISE Implementation Guidance. Agencies
are committed to responsible information sharing under the National Strategy through their
participation in the ISA IPC, the White House‐chaired Senior Information Sharing and Safeguarding
Steering Committee, and the Federal Chief Information Officers Council.</p>
<h3><a href="#section-1c" id="section-1c">ISE Interoperability Framework(I<sup>2</sup>F)</a></h3>
<p>Planning under the National Strategy highlighted a government‐wide need to better describe and
specify common requirements for interoperability and to promulgate guidance on applying sound
information management principles and practices. The ISE Interoperability Framework (I<sup>2</sup>F),
described in Section 3 of this Report, provides an interoperability‐focused enterprise architecture
capability for the ISE. The I<sup>2</sup>F describes a coordinated approach to interoperability built on
common ISE intellectual property: a unifying architecture framework anchored under OMB’s
Common Approach, common profiles, standards and standards‐based acquisition, and reference
architectures. Agencies will use I<sup>2</sup>F to enable integration of core ISE standards and architecture
frameworks into their information technology decisions and implementations, by providing a
direct reusable way of leveraging cross-­‐cutting standards and architecture, and interoperable
capabilities. The I<sup>2</sup>F is foundational to defining and adopting baseline capabilities and common
requirements that enable data, service, and network interoperability, and to implementing the
Federal IT Shared Services Strategy to facilitate adoption of shared services.</p>
<h3><a href="#section-1d" id="section-1d">ISE Management Plan</a></h3>
<p>PM‐ISE is also developing an ISE Management Plan, consistent with existing policy and guidance
from the White House, designed to guide how PM‐ISE and ISE stakeholders collaborate, using
common business processes and tools, to create a unity of effort across the government in
advancing the implementation of the ISE.</p>
<p>The Management Plan describes a process‐oriented approach to effectively manage the
implementation of strategic priorities for responsible information sharing. It serves as a resource for ISE stakeholders, providing mechanisms they can use to participate in the ISE, and includes a
repository of relevant guidance, directives, and illustrative use cases. The ISE Management Plan
will benefit stakeholders by demonstrably providing guidance on how ISE stakeholders:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>
  Identify, prioritize and resolving common problems;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  Assess and manage performance gaps;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  Harmonize policy;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  Convene communities of interest; and</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  Leverage and extend good ideas, best practices, and tools.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The PM-ISE intends to document these
  management processes and the I<sup>2</sup>F to increase awareness, facilitate
  stakeholder integration, and institutionalize management capabilities across the
  ISE.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-1e" id="section-1e">Implementation Roadmap</a></h3>

  <p>As previously done in the 2012 Annual Report, PM-ISE has
  updated an implementation roadmap to plan and coordinate a sustainable agency-based
  approach to accomplishing the goals and realizing the vision of the National
  Strategy, using the ISE Annual Planning Cycle, and the management processes described
  above and in Section 6 of this report. Over the past year, the ISE has undertaken a
  significant effort to clearly define and prioritize the challenges to realizing the
  vision of the National Strategy. This strategic gap analysis resulted in an
  interagency consensus on 16 priority objectives, outlined in the National Strategy,
  charting a path forward for the ISE.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1f" id="section-1f">Change Management - Based on Ongoing and Annual
  	Assessments</a></h4>

  <p>The chart of the implementation roadmap that follows indicates
  which priorities and capabilities are now completed, and which are still outstanding.
  Those that are currently underway, overdue, or newly defined are also identified. The
  PM-ISE and agencies via the ISA IPC have used the ISE Annual Planning Cycle to update
  the Implementation Roadmap, anchored in the prior year's work,
  with a forward-looking view of advancing National Strategy priority objectives.</p>

  <p>Extensive government-wide planning anchored in the ISA IPC has
  allowed for updating incomplete actions and detailing newly defined actions,
  sequenced across a multi-year horizon. Agencies are charged with implementation, and
  assessed with performance measures; all of which establishes a means for measuring
  progress toward National Strategy goals.</p>

  <p>Those capabilities that are determined
  "complete" have been done so based on agency reports
  in the ISE performance questionnaire, tests of the mission-based scenarios, as well
  as the completion of milestones and delivery of outcomes assigned in the annual ISE
  Implementation Guidance. Agency implementation of the roadmap is subject to the
  availability of appropriations, based on agency budgets, and regularly reviewed and
  adjusted through a change management process led by the ISA IPC.</p>

  <p>Agency adoption and integration of the process and tools
  described in the ISE Management Plan and the I<sup>2</sup>F will increase the
  maturity of ISE implementation planning, change management and investment management
  and the overall effectiveness of information sharing and safeguarding.</p>

  <p>The implementation roadmap, framed by the goals of the
  National Strategy, and updated to include FY 2014 Implementation Guidance, is shown
  below:</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-2" id="section-2">Targeting Capabilities Not Yet Achieved</a></h2>
  <p>Those capabilities that have not yet been achieved are identified via the test scenarios, the annual
performance questionnaire and gap analysis, and interagency planning efforts. We expect to see
PM‐ISE and our partner agencies deliver material progress on the following capabilities called for
in the National Strategy during the next reporting period:</p>
<h4><a href="#section-2a" id="section-2a">Goal 1: Drive Collective Action Through Collaboration and Accountability</a></h4>
<ul>
	<li><p>
  Achieve a responsible information sharing culture that leverages best
  practices throughout government, both federal-wide and agency-based, including state,
  local, and tribal government as well as critical infrastructure and key resources,
  and private-sector stakeholders where appropriate (Figure 8: 1.6 and 1.7)</p></li>
	<li><p>
  
  Expanding re-use of existing information sharing tools and technologies,
  such as standardizing agency-level services to align across the ISE; creating common
  exchange processes across all levels of government to enable timely receipt and
  dissemination of information and appropriate responses (RFI and AWN); expanding NSI
  participation (Figure 8: 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4)</p></li>
	<li><p>
  
  Common procedures and templates for interagency information sharing
  agreements; reducing the time needed to build sharing agreements; more attention
  devoted to sharing information with the appropriate users in a timely and trusted
  manner (Figure 8: line 1.8)</p></li>
</ul>

  <h4><a href="#section-2b" id="section-2b">Goal 2:  Improve
  	Information Discovery and Access through Common Standards</a></h4>

  interoperability frameworks (Figure 8: 2.3)</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  
  Discovery and correlation of information across disparate holdings to allow
  data originators to see that responsible information sharing policies are enforced,
  and that authoritative, up-to-date information to identify relationships between
  people, places, things and characteristics that are not otherwise obvious are
  referenced (Figure 8: 2.4)</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a href="#section-2c" id="section-2c">Goal 3:  Optimize

  	<li><p>
  
  Transformation of a domestic information sharing architecture, integrating
  the community through participation in common task forces and functions to enable
  common functions, such as event deconfliction to promote officer safety (Figure 8:
  3.6 and 3.9)</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a href="#section-2d" id="section-2d">Goal 4:  Strengthen
  	Information Safeguarding through Structural Reform, Policy, and Technical
  	Solutions</a></h4>
  <ul>

  to classified information (Figure 8: 4.2)</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  
  Shared audit and cyberthreat information on interconnected networks (Figure
  8: 4.4)</p></li>
  </ul><h4><a href="#section-2e" id="section-2e">Goal 5:  Protect
  	Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties through Consistency and Compliance</a></h4>
  <ul>
    <li><p>
  
  Develop and implement effective compliance, oversight, and accountability
  mechanisms to ensure consistent application of mission-appropriate P/CR/CL
  protections. (Figure 8: 5.1 and 5.2)</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a href="#section-3" id="section-3">PM-ISE
  	Vision, Missions, and Priorities</a></h2>

  <p>PM-ISE, in accordance with IRTPA, has documented a set of
  missions and priorities designed to further the ISE.</p>

  <p>Necessarily an agile organization due to its multiple roles
  and responsibilities, PM-ISE is able to adjust to new requirements for responsible
  information sharing between federal, state, local, tribal, and private-sector
  partners. Though many ISE priorities are addressed through the separate governance
  structures, PM-ISE's role and authority as an executive agent
  allow for an integrated perspective and a unique view of complementary activities,
  dependencies, enabling cross-cuts, alignment, and overlapping missions.</p>

  <p>With its integrated view of National priorities, PM-ISE has
  affirmed the following vision and missions to define its body of work for the next
  year, to include facilitating or supporting, coordinating and executing the ISE
  initiatives agreed to in the Implementation Roadmap.<a href="#_ftn63" id="_ftnref63" title=""><sup>[63]</sup></a></p>

  <h2><a href="#section-4" id="section-4">Conclusion</a></h2>

  <p>We have faced exceptional challenges over the past year,
  including new and evolving threats, increasing amounts of data to manage, and a
  constrained fiscal environment. PM-ISE and our partners have continued to make
  progress in advancing our vision of national security through responsible information
  sharing. Collectively we have laid a path and are building on existing efforts to
  strengthen national capabilities.</p>

  <p>As the National Strategy outlines in its Way Forward:</p>

  <blockquote>
   <p>"Together, we can reach beyond legacy information sharing protocols
   and embed in our missions and cultures the assurance decisions are better informed
   when supported by all relevant information. This also requires, however, a balanced
   commitment to appropriately safeguard information, its sources, and collection
   methods, while also respecting legal and policy restrictions on use. Success
   depends upon the collective ability to achieve equilibrium between sharing and
   safeguarding, build on past successes, and continue the maturation of the
   Information Sharing Environment."</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>In the coming year, we will continue to use all of our
  tools and capabilities to support implementation of the National Strategy and to
  build a stronger information sharing environment. Together with our mission partners,
  we will enhance national security through responsible information sharing.</p>
