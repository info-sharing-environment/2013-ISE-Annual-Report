  	<li>
  		<p>
  		Responses to the 2013 ISE Performance Assessment Questionnaire (PAQ) show
  		mixed results with respect to agency adoption and implementation of incentive tools
  		for information sharing and safeguarding. Ninety percent of responding
  		agencies&mdash;a 10% increase from last year&mdash;reported
  		that "information sharing and collaboration" is an
  		evaluated performance objective for employees with direct ISE responsibilities.
  		However, responding agencies reported a decrease in the number of candidates
  		nominated for information sharing and collaboration awards compared to the previous
  		year.<a href="#_ftn54" id="_ftnref54" title=""><sup>[54]</sup></a></p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a href="#section-1" id="section-1">Improving Governance</a></h2>

  <p>Oversight of the implementation of the
  National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (National Strategy) is a
  government-wide effort being carried out by three committees&mdash;the
  Federal CIO Council, the Steering Committee, and the ISA IPC&mdash;each
  of which uses working groups for these efforts.<a href="#_ftn55" id="_ftnref55" title=""><sup>[55]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Given the number and diversity of
  stakeholders and communities involved, the ability to convene agencies from across
  the government in mature committee structures is critical to getting partners to the
  table, and to agreeing upon efficient implementation plans.</p>

  <p>To support these efforts, ISE agencies are
  increasingly assigning dedicated staff to oversee information sharing and
  safeguarding activities, and to participate in interagency processes to implement
  whole-of-government best practices. According to the 2013 ISE PAQ, 95% of ISE
  agencies report that, in compliance with Executive Order (EO) 13587, they have
  designated a senior official who is accountable for the sharing and safeguarding of
  classified information on computer networks.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-2" id="section-2">The ISE Performance
  	Framework</a></h2>

  <p>In 2013, the office of
  the PM-ISE aligned the ISE performance management framework to the priority
  objectives in the National Strategy. Comprising a roadmap for ISE agencies, the
  framework provides maturity-driven, time-sequenced actions for agencies as they
  implement National Strategy priority objectives and execute other information sharing
  and safeguarding activities in response to annual ISE Implementation Guidance. The
  framework's performance measures allow the office of the PM-ISE to
  assess the maturity of the nations' ability to detect, analyze,
  and respond to terrorism, WMD, and homeland security threats.</p>

  <p>To assist agencies in planning for and
  executing the framework's goal-based initiatives, the office of
  the PM-ISE created a set of mission-based test scenarios that translate strategic
  goals and initiatives into mission-specific narratives. Each narrative is specific to
  an ISE stakeholder's mission, and each shows how that mission may
  be impacted as information sharing and safeguarding capabilities
  mature&mdash;from current capabilities to those that are expected in
  five to seven years. The National Strategy prioritizes the reusable and cross-cutting
  capabilities of the ISE and validates the mission-based test scenarios in the ISE
  performance framework, which are described in detail in Appendix B. Mission-based
  test scenarios assist the ISE by demonstrating information sharing priorities and
  capabilities in a mission context, and allow the ISE to assess progress on desired
  capabilities by providing a line-of-sight view from a National Strategy objective to
  an ISE cross-cutting capability to an agency's program
  implementation.</p>

  <p>For each scenario, PM-ISE has created
  performance measures that reflect expectations for information sharing and
  safeguarding capabilities at each level of maturity in the areas of community,
  process, and technology.<a href="#_ftn56" id="_ftnref56" title=""><sup>[56]</sup></a>This
  gives agencies the tools they need to set milestones and track progress made towards
  the strategic goals. These measures are standardized across all mission
  scenarios&mdash;a methodology which provides a common lexicon for
  discussing the actions needed to achieve our strategic goals for each ISE stakeholder
  mission. ISE agency performance data is an output of this process, as discussed
  throughout this Report, and is detailed in Appendix A.</p>

  <p><img border="0" width="421" height="270" src="assets/img/image094.png" alt="Title: Figure: ISE Performance Framework Capability Areas and Maturity Stages"  /></p>

  <p><small>Figure 5. ISE Performance Framework Capability Areas and Maturity Stages</small></p>

  <h2><a href="#section-3" id="section-3">Budget-Performance Integration</a></h2>
<p>The White House issues programmatic guidance for responsible information sharing. The PM-ISE subsequently issues ISE Implementation Guidance that provides more specific direction for agency activities in order to achieve the priorities defined in the programmatic guidance. The implementation guidance provides the basis for an objective, system-wide set of performance goals for the following year, as required by IRTPA. <a id="_ednref71" href="#_edn71"><sup>[lxxi]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The programmatic guidance defines funding priorities for budget-year development. The implementation guidance, developed collaboratively with the agencies, defines near-term activities for agencies, and informs agencies&rsquo; budget-year development.</p>
  
  <p>ISE Implementation Guidance is an important tool for coordinating the ISE-specific activities of federal agencies. The office of the PM-ISE, through the ISA IPC governance process, tracks the progress of these activities and milestones, ensuring that the ISE continues to advance toward its goals and objectives, and informs performance goals for the following year. Actions are capabilities-focused, aligned with mission objectives, and subject to the annual performance assessment process.</p>
  <p>Throughout the year, the office of the PM-ISE works with agencies to complete the actions specified in the ISE Implementation Guidance. Table 2 provides a status of actions overdue, underway, and due to be completed during the period of July 1, 2012 to May 31, 2013. A detailed account of ISE investments can be found in Appendix C.</p>

<p>Over the next year, with the ISA IPC, the PM-ISE intends to integrate the governance, performance framework, budget and performance integration processes described above, as well as other processes into an ISE Management Plan. The concepts of the ISE Management Plan are discussed further in the Way Forward of this Report.</p>

<h2><a href="#section-4" id="section-4">Responsible Information Sharing Training</a></h2>

<p>Successful sharing of terrorism-related information across the government, with the private sector, and with international allies—in the right format, with the right people, and in a manner that protects privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties—depends upon each individual in the ISE consistently and properly executing responsible information sharing duties. This consistent execution grows out of robust, agency-based programs that provide sustained training to analysts, operators, and investigators with direct ISE responsibilities.</p>

<p>In response to the 2013 ISE PAQ, 86% of agencies reported implementing mission-specific training that supports information sharing and collaboration. 93% of agencies that have implemented this type of training reported seeing improvements with respect to information sharing and stewardship as a result of these training programs.<a href="#_ftn57" id="_ftnref57"><sup>[57]</sup></a></p>

<h3><a href="#section-4a" id="section-4a">Risk Analysis Courses</a></h3>

<p>DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&amp;A) worked with the DHS Homeland Infrastructure Threat and Risk Analysis Center (HITRAC) and FEMA to deliver introductory and intermediate risk analysis training courses for fusion center analysts. The courses were developed to help intelligence analysts and critical infrastructure protection analysts gain an enhanced understanding of risk analysis through the application of the core components of risk (threat, vulnerability, and consequence), and by highlighting sample fusion center risk products. Participants gained the appropriate training, tools, and mentoring to develop a sample fusion center risk product and a stronger peer-to-peer network. DHS has delivered more than 16 of these trainings in 12 states to date.</p>

<h3><a href="#section-4b" id="section-4b">Specialized Analytic Seminar Series</a></h3>

<p>Beginning in February 2013, DHS sponsored a bi-monthly series of specialized analytic seminars designed to enhance the capabilities of fusion center analysts by bringing together a diverse range of subject matter experts in seminars to discuss the knowledge, skills, and resources necessary to effectively monitor and evaluate potential threats in analysts&rsquo; areas of responsibility. The series addressed the following topics in the context of fusion center operations: Human Trafficking; Financial Crimes; All Hazards; Gangs; Maritime; and Drugs.</p>

  <p>Forty-five fusion center analysts participated in the first seminar on human trafficking. The workshop provided an overview of human trafficking indicators, briefings on trafficking trends and tactics, as well as a panel discussion on resources available to support state and local analysts. The seminar also included several case studies presented by state and local officials on human trafficking products. Partner organizations included the DHS Blue Campaign, the FBI, the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center, ICE, and the Human Smuggling and Trafficking Center (HSTC).</p>
  
<h3><a href="#section-4c" id="section-4c">Cyber Analysis Training</a></h3>

<p>In November 2012, DHS I&amp;A, in partnership with USSS, sponsored a cyber-analysis training pilot program. Approximately 20 fusion center cyber analysts from around the country attended. The program focused on the current threats, best practices, and resources available to fusion center analysts. Three additional courses will be delivered in 2013. In February 2013, the FBI held the first annual National Cyber Executive Institute, a three-day seminar to train industry executives on cyber threat awareness and information sharing.</p>

<h3><a href="#section-4d" id="section-4d">SAR Analysis Course</a></h3>

<p><img src="assets/img/image385.png" class="right" alt="SAR Analysis Course"/>DHS I&amp;A partnered with the NSI PMO to support the delivery of a series of SAR analysis courses designed to assist analysts to better understand processes for reviewing and vetting SAR, as well as processes for formally analyzing SAR to inform fusion center analytic efforts and products. The SAR Analysis courses provide instruction on various methods and approaches to analyzing SAR as part of overall analytic processes. Specifically, the course will instruct participants in the methods for evaluating SAR; for conducting structured inquiry focused on SAR trends, relationship, and patterns; and for incorporating SAR analysis into fusion center product development. Additionally, the FBI retooled the NSI&rsquo;s SAR analytic training course for the purpose of providing the course to federal partners, as part of the NSI Federal Plan.</p>

<h3><a href="#section-4e" id="section-4e">National Fusion Center Analytic Workshop</a></h3>

<p>On January 15-17, 2013, DHS sponsored a National Analytic workshop designed to support the continued development of the National Network&rsquo;s Critical Operational Capability 2 (Analyze)—the ability to assess local implications of threat information through the use of a formal risk assessment process. The meeting covered topics ranging from privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties, to human trafficking, to cybersecurity, to regional strategic threat assessment development, to critical infrastructure protection and risk analysis. Nearly 200 people attended, representing fusion centers from throughout the country. The NSI SAR Analyst course was also provided as an optional training course during the last day of this workshop.</p>

<h3><a href="#section-4f" id="section-4f">NSI Training</a></h3>

<p>The NSI training strategy is designed to increase the effectiveness of state, local, tribal, and territorial law enforcement and public safety professionals and other frontline partners in identifying, reporting, evaluating, and sharing pre-incident terrorism indicators to prevent acts of terrorism.</p>

<p>The 2013 ISE PAQ data indicates that more than 80% of federal ISE agencies provide SAR training to their personnel. To date, DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA) has trained more than 110,000 federal law enforcement officers, and a total of 291,502 line officers from all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and Guam. In addition, BJA trained a total of 2,196 law enforcement analysts within both fusion centers and the Federal Government, and is working with the New York City Fire Department to institutionalize the SAR training within their training academy. The NSI conducted more than 70 speaking engagements in 2012, reaching homeland security advisors, chiefs of police, state colonels, sheriffs, critical infrastructure key resources owners and operators, tribal law enforcement executives, private sector security executives, probation/parole/corrections executives, fire/emergency management services personnel, fusion center directors, and federal partners.</p>

<h3><a href="#section-4g" id="section-4g">SAR – Maritime Training</a></h3>

<p> <img src="assets/img/image386.png" class="right" alt="SAR – Maritime Training"/>The National Maritime Intelligence-Integration Office (NMIO), in partnership with the NSI PMO and in coordination with the USCG, is delivering a new SAR awareness training module to increase awareness among the maritime sector&rsquo;s workers, security personnel, and executives. The program will be identical in format to NSI PMO&rsquo;s other &ldquo;Hometown Security Partners&rdquo; training, and will be accessed through online training portals.</p>

<p>The training will educate those in the maritime industry who have a potential of being exposed to indicators and behaviors associated with criminal and or terrorist activity. Additionally, the NSI PMO, the NMIO, the DHS, the FBI, and the USCG have partnered and begun visiting 10 U.S. port facilities to increase NSI-Maritime Safety Information awareness, and to capture best practices regarding the SAR program in each port.</p>

<h3><a href="#section-4h" id="section-4h">NIEM Biometrics Domain Training</a></h3>

<p>On February 26, 2013 the NIEM Biometrics Domain kicked off a new training initiative, the first in a series designed to share knowledge of NIEM and the NIEM Biometrics Domain, which operates under the stewardship of the DHS Office of Biometric Identity Management (OBIM). The session focused on tailoring NIEM resources to best reach the biometrics community, with the goal of raising awareness and understanding of the standardized information sharing capabilities, best practices, and resources available to biometric stakeholders worldwide. The training included an overview of NIEM governance, domains, tools, models, Implementation Exchange Package Documentations, and the NIEM value proposition.</p>

<h2><a href="#section-5" id="section-5">Performance Incentives</a></h2>
<p>Effective and secure information sharing is ultimately the result of, and completely dependent upon, the daily actions of the countless individuals within the ISE. A workforce that is well trained and incentivized to share and protect information in the execution of their daily duties is a requisite precondition for achieving the National Strategy&rsquo;s vision of providing the right information, at the right time, to any authorized user. Including responsible information sharing objectives in performance appraisals, and creating agency awards for responsible information sharing, can be powerful tools to help achieve this vision.</p>

<p>Responses to 2013 ISE PAQ show mixed results with respect to agency adoption and implementation of these tools: 90% of responding agencies, a 10% increase from last year, reported that &ldquo;information sharing and collaboration&rdquo; is an evaluated performance objective for employees with direct ISE responsibilities.<a href="#_ftn58" id="_ftnref58"> <sup>[58]</sup> </a> Interestingly, responding agencies reported a decrease in the nomination of candidates for information sharing and collaboration awards from last year—a troubling trend when taken at face value. However, it is unclear what is causing the decline. It could be that as information sharing and collaboration become integrated as key components of job functions, especially those jobs that require interagency collaboration, specific incentives for information sharing are less likely to be awarded.</p>

<p>This supposition is supported by the increase in the incorporation of information sharing performance objectives by agencies, and the fact that 71% of agencies—up from 62% last year—report that they offer mission-specific training that supports information sharing and collaboration. It could also be the case that the current fiscal environment, including the Federal Government&rsquo;s required response to sequestration, has made it necessary to cut back on monetary awards. Further analysis is being done to interpret these results.</p>

<h2><a href="#section-6" id="section-6">Building Blocks of the ISE</a></h2>

<p>Leveraging ISE partners&rsquo; lessons learned and best practices to enable collaboration and re-use is critical to the success of the ISE. In order to make available the requisite tools to achieve this, the office of the PM-ISE launched &ldquo;Building Blocks&rdquo; in August 2012.</p>

<p>Building Blocks is an online, public-facing training tool available on <a href="http://www.ise.gov">www.ise.gov</a> that provides an in-depth view of how the office of the PM-ISE, with its partners, creates a responsible Information Sharing Environment. The tool outlines the five foundational components that government agencies and organizations can use to build responsible information sharing programs: Governance, Budget &amp; Performance, Acquisition, Standards &amp; Interoperability, and Communications &amp; Partnerships. The tool is designed to help ISE mission partners find and share best practices, guidelines, and lessons learned with other partner agencies as well as with the public.</p>

<p><small>Figure 6. The Building Blocks of the ISE.</small></p>

<p>Building Blocks highlights ISE partner success stories by outlining how they were able to implement information sharing guidelines within their own agency. Learning how to establish a governing body, build a strategy, and then develop performance measures against that strategy are just a few of the topics detailed on the tool.</p>

<p>Users are also guided through the process of developing an implementation plan, building in interoperability, and applying standards. The toolkit explains the importance of fostering engagement with stakeholders and the practical concepts behind privacy and security implications.</p>

<p>In March 2013, the office of the PM-ISE launched the Data Exchange Toolkit using a pilot conducted by DHS and NCTC. This toolkit is available on the Building Blocks site, and guides users through the basic steps needed to evaluate and improve existing data exchanges. Users first define scope and identify candidates for the exchange. Next, users access and identify solutions; then plan and implement those solutions. Finally, the toolkit explains how to evaluate improvements achieved.</p>

  It is unclear what caused this decline. One possible explanation is that specific
  incentives for information sharing are less likely to be awarded as information
  sharing and collaboration are gradually becoming key components of job functions,
  especially those jobs that require interagency collaboration. This supposition is
  supported by the increase in employee information sharing performance objectives,
  and the fact that 71% of agencies, up from 62% last year, report that they offer
  mission-specific training that supports information sharing and collaboration.
  Although there is no supporting data, it is also possible that the current fiscal
  environment has made it necessary to cut back on monetary awards. Further analysis
