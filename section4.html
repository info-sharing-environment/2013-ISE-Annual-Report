  <h1><a href="#section-0" id="section-0">Section 4: Strengthening Safeguarding of Information</a></h1>

  <p>This section describes key achievements over the past year in
  safeguarding the capabilities that most directly relate to the advancement of
  information sharing, and specifically to the relevant characteristics of the ISE. It
  does not attempt to describe <em>all</em> Federal Government
  security-related activities or achievements.</p>

  <p>The need to both protect and share national security and
  counterterrorism-related information that is stored on and disseminated
  electronically from Federal Government information systems has become of increasingly
  critical importance. Sharing and safeguarding information requires that we enforce
  the controls necessary to protect sensitive and classified
  information&mdash;and the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of
  individuals&mdash;while also providing efficient access to
  mission-critical information in order to enable analysts, operators, and
  investigators to effectively perform their jobs.</p>

  <blockquote>
   <p>"...strike the proper balance
   between sharing information with those who need it to keep our country safe and
   safeguarding it from those who would do us harm."<a href="#_ftn49" id="_ftnref49" title=""><sup>[49]</sup></a></p>

   <small>President Barack Obama</small>
  </blockquote>

  <p>Recent information breaches and disclosures highlight
  vulnerabilities in the protection of sensitive and classified information. Continued
  implementation of structural reform and standardized policies, however, will
  strengthen oversight as well as align security best practices.</p>

  <p>The release of Executive Order
  13587&mdash;<em>Structural Reforms to Improve the Security of Classified
  Networks and the Responsible Sharing and Safeguarding of Classified Information</em>
  &mdash; in October 2011, and the December 2012 White
  House release of <em>The National Strategy for Information Sharing and
  Safeguarding</em> (National Strategy) have provided additional policy
  guidance for driving improvements in the sharing and safeguarding of classified
  information.</p>

  <p>While departments and agencies made some progress in improving
  the security of classified networks during the last reporting period, recent events
  involving insider threats reinforce the need to continue the work begun under EO
  13587 in order to make substantive improvements to safeguarding the security of our
  classified networks.</p>

  <p>The Steering Committee has mapped out clear, consensus-based
  goals and a plan for measuring progress on classified sharing and safeguarding.</p>

  <p>In 2013, the Steering Committee will continue to oversee
  Department and Agency implementation of initial priorities, and will develop and
  implement plans for addressing emerging vulnerabilities on classified systems. These
  actions will continue to improve the security of our classified information and
  systems, and will enhance the support of our critical national security missions,
  while continuing to promote responsible sharing of classified information.</p>

  <p>The following list of findings highlights accomplishments and
  opportunities for improvement. Further detail is provided in the following pages of
  this section.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-0a" id="section-0a">Accomplishments</a></h4>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>
   The
  Administration disseminated in November 2012 a Presidential Memorandum on the
  National Insider Threat Policy and Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider
  Threat Programs;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   DHS
  expanded its Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) program, in accordance with EO
  13636, <em>Improving Critical Infrastructure Cybersecurity,</em> to
  better assist critical infrastructure owners and operators in improving protection of
  their systems from unauthorized access, exploitation, or data
  exfiltration;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   HHS
  established a Cyber Threat Analysis Unit (CTAU) to develop indicators of compromise,
  and to detect intrusions or exfiltrations of HHS systems or data at their earliest
  stages;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (DECS) activity was
  approved as an optional element of the DoD's DIB Cybersecurity and
  Information Assurance (CS/IA) Program, providing a means for the Federal Government
  to share classified cybersecurity information with Cleared Defense Contractors
  (CDC);</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   DoD
  is rolling out a program that will allow users of mobile devices working
  anywhere&mdash;from remote battlefields to the
  Pentagon&mdash;to rapidly share classified information and protected
  data across all components;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  IACP co-hosted a Cyber Threat Roundtable with DHS that brought together more than 20
  state and local representatives, and various associations from across the
  country;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative Five (CNCI-5) led the Federal
  Cybersecurity Centers<a href="#_ftn50" id="_ftnref50" title=""><sup>[50]</sup></a> in
  documenting their requirements for government-wide, cybersecurity information
  sharing.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a href="#section-0b" id="section-0b">Opportunities</a></h4>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>
  
  Continuing efforts by the Steering Committee to advance the priority areas
  will improve security by strengthening the identification of individuals who are
  accessing classified systems; limiting access on the basis of the
  individual's "need-to-know" through
  technical controls; reducing the opportunity for information to be removed from the
  secure environment; improving efforts against insider threats; and improving audit
  capabilities. Considerable work remains in three priority areas: Reduced Anonymity,
  Access Control, and Enterprise Audit.</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   As
  noted last year, cybersecurity can be improved through effectively sharing
  cyber-vulnerability and intrusion information; and the ISE's
  information sharing processes can enable cybersecurity information sharing. The work
  of CNCI-5 and the focus of FEMA's National Level Exercise (NLE)
  2012, detailed in this section, highlight the ways in which the sharing of
  cybersecurity information can make networks more secure.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a href="#section-1" id="section-1">Threat Environment and Vulnerabilities</a></h2>

  <p>As in the unclassified environment, the threats to classified
  systems and information are real, growing, and multidimensional. The classified
  environment also presents an increasingly complex threat and risk environment
  resulting from increasing interconnection of systems as well as shared services and
  their human users.</p>

  <p>Our understanding of the threats and associated
  vulnerabilities for classified systems and information is also improving. The
  increasing interconnection of classified systems and the flow of information across
  systems will increase the potential impact of compromises to the security of this
  information.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-2" id="section-2">Establishing Priorities</a></h2>

  <p>The Steering Committee identified five priority areas for
  departments and agencies to focus their efforts in improving the safeguarding of
  classified information within their classified networks, with the understanding that
  these areas will take several years to fully implement.</p>

  <p>These priorities include:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p> Removable Media</p></li>
  	<li><p> Insider Threat Programs</p></li>
  	<li><p> Reduced Anonymity</p></li>
  	<li><p> Access Control</p></li>
  	<li><p> Enterprise Audit</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>In 2012, the Steering Committee developed clear,
  consensus-based goal descriptions for each priority, which included identifying
  initial and final milestones [(initial operating capability [IOC] and final operating
  capability [FOC], respectively)]. IOC represents a minimum threshold of immediate
  improvements needed to safeguard classified networks, while FOC represents the
  end-state capability required for sustained, comprehensive protection of classified
  networks.</p>

  <p>The Steering Committee has requested all departments and
  agencies that handle classified information to apply milestone definitions to their
  respective operating environments and to forecast when they will be able to verify
  attainment of IOC and FOC for each priority.</p>

  <p>Each department and agency is starting from a different
  capability and resource level. Each has projected different timeframes for
  completion, based on its starting point and resources. Because of this mixed picture,
  and the need for collective attainment of IOC and FOC goals to manage shared risk,
  the Steering Committee is actively working with the departments and agencies to
  accelerate IOC and FOC attainment.<a href="#_edn67" id="_ednref67" title=""><sup>[lxvii]</sup></a></p>

  <h2><a href="#section-3" id="section-3">Areas of Progress</a></h2>

  <p>To evaluate individual and collective progress on the
  priorities, the Steering Committee developed a set of information sharing and
  safeguarding indicators. The 39 departments and agencies that handle classified
  information on computer networks each submitted quarterly progress reports on these
  indicators. Two safeguarding indicator areas&mdash;removable media and
  implementing insider threat capabilities&mdash;made progress over the
  past year based on the quarterly analysis of agency reporting.</p>

  <p>
  <img border="0" width="374" height="105" src="assets/img/image076.png" alt="Title: Figure: Implementing Insider Threat Capabilities - Description: Percent of departments and agencies implementing Removable Media Practices: Implemented = 74%, In Progress (not yet implemented) = 26% Percent of departments and agencies implementing Specified Insider Threat Capabilities: Implemented = 56%, In Progress (not yet implemented) = 44%"  /></p>

 <p><small>Figure 2. Departments and Agencies made some progress in 2012 towards reaching the full
operating capability for
Removable Media Management and initial operating capability for Implementing Insider Threat
Capabilities.</small></p>
  <p>On November 21, 2012, a Presidential Memorandum on the National Insider Threat Policy and
Minimum Standards for Executive Branch Insider Threat Programs, developed by the interagency
Insider Threat Task Force (ITTF), was disseminated to the heads of all departments and agencies.
The Minimum Standards provide departments and agencies with the elements necessary to
establish effective insider threat programs. Elements include the capability of gathering,
integrating, and centrally analyzing and responding to key threat-related information; monitoring
employee use of classified networks; providing the workforce with insider threat awareness
training; and protecting the civil liberties and privacy of all personnel.</p>
<p>The ITTF has conducted insider threat forums to introduce and explain the policy and standards to agency leaders.</p>

<h2><a href="#section-4" id="section-4">Remaining Gaps and Emerging Vulnerabilities</a></h2>
<p>Although departments and agencies made some progress in 2012 on the first two
priorities&mdash;Removable Media, and Implementing Insider Threat Capabilities&mdash;considerable work
remains on these two priorities, as well as on the other three priorities, and on emerging
vulnerabilities to classified systems and information. Gaps in reaching IOC and FOC represent
continuing vulnerabilities for classified systems and information.</p>
<p>Our continuing efforts in these priority areas will improve security by strengthening the
identification of individuals accessing classified systems; limiting access on a basis of the
individual’s "need‐to‐know" through technical controls; reducing the opportunity for information
to be removed from the secure environment; improving efforts to prevent insider threats; and
improving audit capabilities. Additional discussion on gaps and vulnerabilities is included in the
classified supplement to this report.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-5" id="section-5">The Way Forward for Strengthening Safeguarding in
  	2013</a></h2>

  <p>Numerous cross-cutting federal committees are collaborating to
  establish best practices through the Federal Identity and Access Management and the
  Joint Continuous Monitoring Group, which will address the other three priorities:
  Reducing Anonymity, Accessing Control, and Enterprise Auditing.</p>

  <p>In 2013, the Steering Committee will continue to oversee the
  progress of departments and agencies on the first five priorities, identified in
  2012. Additionally, the Steering Committee will oversee the commencement of
  independent assessments, conducted by the Executive Agent for Safeguarding Classified
  Information on Computer Networks and the Insider Threat Task Force.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-6" id="section-6">Other Key Safeguarding-related Accomplishments</a></h2>

  <p>A number of other notable safeguarding accomplishments merit
  recognition. The section below highlights progress in several areas.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-6a" id="section-6a">Defense</a></h3>

  <h4><a href="#section-6b" id="section-6b">PKI Hard Tokens - DoD Common Service Provider</a></h4>

  <p>During this reporting period, the Steering Committee
  determined that all agencies operating on Federal Government classified or Secret
  networks must implement a hardware-based Public-key Infrastructure (PKI) solution to
  protect their information and networks; remove anonymity; and improve the overall
  security of federal Secret networks.</p>

  <p>DoD, which was already in the process of implementing a PKI
  Secret Internet Protocol Router Network (SIPRNET) token capability, decided to
  leverage its existing infrastructure to stand up a common service provider (CSP)
  capability for all federal agencies, with the exception of those agencies who have
  their own systems. The Defense Information Systems Agency (DISA) is the operator of
  DoD PKI, and will be the CSP for the federal agencies.<a href="#_edn68" id="_ednref68" title=""><sup>[lxviii]</sup></a></p>

  <p>Further discussion on how PKI solutions are protecting the Top
  Secret networks is found in the classified supplement to this Report.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-6c" id="section-6c">Joint Information Environment</a><a href="#_ftn51" id="_ftnref51" title=""><sup>[51]</sup></a></h4>

  <p>The Defense Department continues to work toward transformation
  into a joint information environment, with defense industry and interagency partners,
  in support of the President's cybersecurity policy to establish a
  framework for a voluntary process to share information on cyber attacks and potential
  security risks to the nation's critical infrastructure.</p>

  <p>In May 2012 an information sharing program between DoD and
  eligible Defense Industrial Base (DIB) companies was formally established with the
  publication of a federal rule, 32 CFR Part 236, DoD-DIB Voluntary
  Cybersecurity/Information Assurance (CS/IA) Activities.</p>

  <p>This voluntary program enhances and supplements DIB
  participants' capabilities to safeguard DoD information that
  resides on, or transits, DIB unclassified information systems.</p>

  <p>Under the DIB CS/IA program, DoD provides classified and
  unclassified cyber-threat information and information assurance best practices to DIB
  participants. In turn, DIB participants report cyber incidents that may involve DoD
  information for analysis, the development of coordinated mitigation strategies, and,
  when needed, cyber intrusion damage assessments of compromised DoD information. The
  DoD Cyber Crime Center is the DIB CS/IA operational focal point for cyber threat
  information sharing, DIB incident reporting, and response.</p>

  <p>The Defense Department's information
  priorities include defining the joint information environment architecture for
  military networks; addressing redundant security infrastructure; and providing
  command and control to the U.S. military and its mission partners to enable enhanced
  communications and to promote mission accomplishment.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-6d" id="section-6d">Defense Cyber Crime Center (DC3)</a></h4>

  <p>
  <img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image078.png" alt="Title: DC3 - Description: Image of Defense Cyber Crime Center logo." class="right"  />DC3 is a national cyber center and serves as the
operational focal point for the Defense Industrial Base Cybersecurity and Information
Assurance (DIB CS/IA) Program.</p>

  <p>The DC3 DoD-Defense Industrial Base Collaborative Information
  Sharing Environment (DCISE) is the hub for cyber analysis and information sharing
  between Defense Industrial Base (DIB) Partners and U.S. Government (USG)
  Stakeholders.</p>

  <p>Established in 2007 in response to the critical need to
  improve information sharing, DC3/DCISE is the DoD focal point for the voluntary DIB
  CS/IA Program which was formed to assist DIB companies in safeguarding DoD
  unclassified information residing on or transiting DIB unclassified networks.</p>

  <p>DC3/DCISE produces actionable threat
  products&mdash;the unclassified Threat Information Product(s) (TIPS)
  provide indicators that companies can use at their discretion to help defend their
  corporate networks.</p>

  <p>
  <img border="0" width="365" height="172" src="assets/img/image080.png" alt="Title: Figure: The Incident Collection Form (ICF) is used by DIB partners to submit incident data to DC3 via a secure web site. - Description: DIB Partner Reporting: 177% increase from FY 2011 to FY 2012. # of ICFs: FY 2008 = 20 FY 2009 = 139 FY 2010 = 206 FY 2011 = 335 FY 2012 = 928 FY 2013 = 927 # of DIB Partners: FY 2008 = 24 FY 2009 = 29 FY 2010 = 36 FY 2011 = 36 FY 2012 = 62 FY 2013 = 92"  /></p>

  <p>
  	<small>Figure 3. The Incident Collection Form (ICF) is used by DIB partners to submit incident data to DC3 via a secure web site.</small>
  </p>

  <p>When partner companies report events, according to a mutually agreed tiered schema, DC3/DCISE performs analysis and diagnostics and remediation consults, backed up by forensics and malware analysis from DC3 Defense Computer Forensics Laboratory (DCFL).</p>
  <p>Beyond simply providing threat products, the partnership is promoting a change in business culture with respect to how partner companies make decisions to protect their key intellectual property.</p>
  <p>As the U.S. continues to face enormous challenges in protecting aiding industry in protecting its intellectual property, the processes developed by the DC3/DCISE and the trust relationships established with the DIB partners also help afford the USG a unique and valuable aperture on threats to the Defense Industrial Base.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-6e" id="section-6e">Securing Information on Mobile Devices</a></h4>

  <p><img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image082.png" alt="Title: Mobile Devices - Description: Image of a Blackberry phone." class="right"  />DoD is rolling out a program that will allow users to employ a
  range of mobile devices&mdash;working anywhere in the world, from remote
  battlefields to the Pentagon&mdash;to rapidly share classified
  information and protected data.</p>

  <p>The goal of the implementation plan is to ensure that mobile
  devices throughout the Department&mdash;as well as their apps, email,
  other functions, and the wireless networks supporting them&mdash;can
  operate securely even in hostile and remote environments, and can adapt to changing
  technology and a growing number of users.</p>

  <p>Officials have established a phased implementation plan
  involving vendor competition for development of a system that could serve as a model
  for large companies that also need to protect the transmission of both open and
  confidential data.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-6f" id="section-6f">Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties Protections
  	(P/CR/CL)</a></h3>

  <p>
  <img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image084.png" alt="Title: White House - Description: Image of the White House." class="left"  />Safeguarding activities covered under EO 13587 present
additional opportunities for building P/CR/CL protections at the programmatic level. The
Steering Committee is coordinating with National Security Staff to enhance insider threat
and continuous monitoring programs. To support the implementation of these programs,
agency legal counsel and P/CR/CL officers have developed guidance for federal agencies to
incorporate into their respective agency policy documents and other tools supporting
comprehensive P/CR/CL safeguarding programs.</p>

   the nation's critical cyber and communications networks
   and infrastructure. As such, DHS directly supports federal civilian
   departments and agencies in developing capabilities that will improve their
   cybersecurity posture in accordance with the Federal Information Security
   Management Act (FISMA); and works regularly with critical infrastructure
   owners and operators to strengthen their facilities, respond to threats, and

   this, the DHS Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (ECS) program was expanded in
   February 2013 by EO 13636, Improving Critical Infrastructure
   Cybersecurity.</p>

   <p>ECS is a voluntary information
   sharing program that assists critical infrastructure owners and operators to
   improve protection of their systems from unauthorized access, exploitation,
   or data exfiltration. ECS consists of the operational processes and security
   oversight required to share sensitive and classified cyber threat information
   with qualified Commercial Service Providers that will enable them to better
   protect their customers&mdash;critical infrastructure entities.
   ECS augments, but does not replace, these entities'
   existing cybersecurity capabilities. The ECS information sharing process
   protects critical infrastructure entities against cyber threats that could
   otherwise harm their systems.<a href="#_edn69" id="_ednref69" title=""><sup>[lxix]</sup></a></p>

   <p>In May 2012, the Defense Industrial
   Base (DIB) Enhanced Cybersecurity Services (DECS) activity was approved as an
   optional element of the DoD's preexisting DIB
   Cybersecurity and Information Assurance (CS/IA) Program. DECS provides a
   means for the Federal Government to share classified cybersecurity
   information with cleared defense contractors to enable enhanced cybersecurity
   protections for defense information that resides on or passes through DIB
   networks and systems.</p>

   <h5><a href="#section-7b" id="section-7b">Comprehensive National
   		Cybersecurity Initiative Five (CNCI-5)</a></h5>

   <p>The Comprehensive National
   Cybersecurity Initiative Five (CNCI-5) led the federal cybersecurity
   centers<a href="#_ftn52" id="_ftnref52" title=""><sup>[52]</sup></a>
   to document their requirements for government-wide,
   cybersecurity information sharing, while accommodating legal, privacy, and
   policy considerations. CNCI-5's work focuses on developing
   requirements for the information sharing architecture (ISA). Currently, the
   federal cybersecurity centers are developing an implementation plan to
   accelerate development of the ISA in FY 2014.</p>

   <p>The concepts are being tested by an
   Enhanced Shared Situational Awareness (ESSA) Pilot to share spear-phishing
   threat activity between the United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team
   (US-CERT) and the NSA Threat Operations Center (NTOC). The pilot validated
   ESSA technology requirements, as well as highlighting the need for additional
   inter-departmental work on cybersecurity information sharing policies.
   Accordingly, CNCI-5 chartered a working group to create a government-wide
   policy framework.</p>

   <h5><a href="#section-7c" id="section-7c">Department of Health and Human
   		Services (HHS) Cyber Threat Analysis Unit</a></h5>

   <p>HHS is a world leader in the
   development of health-related research, technical data, and sensitive
   information impacting global health security. As intelligence trends and
   cyber intrusions have demonstrated in recent years, sensitive information and
   intellectual property are targeted not only by foreign intelligence services
   and foreign actors, but others as well, e.g. academic and research
   institutions; and private-sector companies. Losses of sensitive economic
   information and intellectual property to hostile actors or foreign
   adversaries pose significant national security risks and economic
   costs.</p>

   <p>The HHS Office of Security and
   Strategic Information (OSSI) has established a Cyber Threat Analysis Unit
   (CTAU), which is building forensic capabilities to address these threats and
   support the operational mission of the HHS operating divisions that are most
   targeted for their highly sought-after intellectual property and sensitive
   technical data and research; divisions like the Centers for Disease Control
   and Prevention, the Food and Drug Administration, the Centers for Medicare
   &amp; Medicaid Services, and the National Institutes of Health.</p>

   <p>CTAU conducts in-depth analysis of
   IC and law enforcement cyber intelligence, and information on attempted
   intrusions into HHS networks, and uses trend analysis and forensics to
   examine threats, conduct predictive analysis, categorize vulnerabilities, and
   develop indicators of compromise to detect intrusions or exfiltrations at
   their earliest stages. Within HHS, OSSI is disseminating cyber threat
   information across the operating divisions to ensure that vulnerabilities are
   addressed and techniques are readily identified to safeguard networks from
   intrusions or cyber attacks.</p>

   		Governments</a></h5>

   <p><strong>Fusion Center Cybersecurity
   	Evaluation Environment</strong></p>

   <p>The office of the PM-ISE assisted
   the National Fusion Center Association (NFCA) and the International
   Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) by facilitating a Cybersecurity
   Evaluation Environment Pilot Kick-off event in conjunction with the Northern
   California Regional Intelligence Center (NCRIC).</p>

   <p><img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image086.png"  alt="Title: San Francisco - Description: Image of the Palace of Fine Arts and the San Francisco Bay." class="right"   />The event built
   upon previous discussions (primarily during an August 2012 meeting hosted by
   the NCRIC, and the December 2012 DHS-IACP Cybersecurity Roundtable), and was
   held to generate multi-organizational support and urgency for piloting a
   Fusion Center cyber information sharing capability in 2013.</p>

   <p>The event focused on:</p>
   <ol>
   	<li><p>Soliciting cyber information sharing requirements from
   industry partners;</p></li>
   	<li><p>Articulating the government's
   perspective on and potential processes for information sharing with the
   private sector; and</p></li>
   	<li><p>Explaining federal, state, and local government
   requirements for cyber information sharing within the government.</p></li>
   </ol>

   <p>Participants reached consensus
   concerning high-level requirements, themes, and elements of a common vision
   for the future of cybersecurity information sharing.</p>

   <p>Next steps include piloting Federal
   Cyber Center information sharing with fusion centers by leveraging current
   information sharing activities and business processes to enhance:</p>
   <ol>
   	<li><p>Protection of state, local, and CIKR networks;</p></li>
   	<li><p>Cyber crime investigations; and</p></li>
   	<li><p>Resiliency and response with integrated information
   sharing.</p></li>
