  <h1><a href="#section-0" id="section-0">Section 1: Collective Action through Collaboration and Accountability</a></h1>

  <p>This section addresses the maturation of
  foundational ISE mission processes, including progress made on existing information
  sharing procedures between the federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial
  governments, private-sector, and foreign partners and allies. Many of these
  activities were called out in the 2007 National Strategy for Information Sharing,
  which remains in effect and continues to guide ISE activities.</p>

  <p>This section also examines new and emerging
  information sharing initiatives in both traditional terrorism and homeland security
  missions, and other missions that collect and maintain data to support traditional
  ISE mission processes. Many of these activities are identified as priorities in the
  National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (National Strategy), or
  have been the focus of recent reporting by the GAO. Where this is the case, it is
  noted in this section.</p>

  <p>The following list of findings highlights
  both accomplishments and opportunities for additional improvement. Further detail is
  provided in the pages that follow.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-0a" id="section-0a">Accomplishments</a></h4>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>
  The Administration released three national-level policy directives that
  reinforce the importance of information sharing with private-sector critical
  infrastructure owners and operators, and that boost security and resiliency as a
  national priority;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  NCTC, DHS, and the FBI established the Joint Counterterrorism Assessment
  Team (JCAT) as the successor organization to the Interagency Threat Assessment and
  Coordination Group (ITACG);</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The FBI added the National Palm Print System (NPPS) and Enhanced Latent
  Functionality to its Next Generation Identification System (NGI). With its
  deployment, NGI users immediately benefited from accuracy three times greater than
  that of pre-deployment levels;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  DHS established the Field Analytic Support Task Force (FAST) to advocate
  for state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government
  agencies' intelligence requirements, and to collaborate with
  federal agencies to share intelligence products with SLTT government
  partners;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis (I&amp;A) hosted the first exercise
  under the Fusion Center Performance Program (FCPP), a performance management
  framework designed to measure the impact and value of individual fusion centers and
  the National Network of Fusion Centers;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  DHS migrated the Homeland Security Information Network (HSIN) and its
  Critical Infrastructure Community of Interest to a new platform in order to improve
  private-sector partners access to sensitive but unclassified information;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  <img width="109" height="109" src="assets/img/image008.png" alt="Title: IACP - Description: International Association of Chiefs of Police logo." class="right"  />The International
  Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and the PM-ISE are sponsoring a Unified
  Message Task Team (UMTT) to enhance Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) training,
  metrics, and policies;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The Global Justice Sharing Initiative (Global) put out a call to action
  challenging governors, sheriffs, chiefs of police, and other Global Advisory
  Committee (GAC)<a href="#_ftn13" id="_ftnref13" title=""><sup>[13]</sup></a>members
  to adopt strategic solutions to transform the nation's justice and
  public safety information sharing activities&mdash;the tenets of which
  are being used to build state and regional information sharing environments;
  and</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The office of the PM-ISE is working closely with the U.S. Chief Technology
  Officer (CTO) and the Council on Women and Girls to support efforts to utilize
  innovative technology and advanced intelligence analysis to better target criminal
  investigations of human traffickers.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a href="#section-0b" id="section-0b">Opportunities</a></h4>

  <ul>
  	<li><p>
  Resource constraints, especially among SLTT law enforcement agencies, have
  necessitated the transformation of information sharing business models. A significant
  cost savings could be realized through consolidation, regionalization, and reuse of
  open standards and trusted IT platforms. The Global call to action to SLTT partners
  and the PM-ISE-sponsored nationwide deconfliction strategy are seeking to address
  this.</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  Many of the challenges noted in last year's report with
  respect to information sharing between the Federal Government and private-sector
  owner/operators of critical infrastructure persist, but there has been a concerted
  effort on the part of the Federal Government over the past twelve months to address
  the findings of the National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC). Details of these
  activities are included in this section of the Report, under the heading,
  "Private Sector Information Sharing."</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  <img width="108" height="109" src="assets/img/image010.png" alt="Title: Totem - Description: Image of a totem pole." class="right"  />Gaps continue in information sharing
with tribal law enforcement agencies. This year the office of the PM-ISE, in coordination
with the Department of the Interior (DOI), DOI's Bureau of Indian
Affairs (BIA), the Department of Justice (DOJ), DOJ's Office of Tribal
Justice (OTJ), NCTC, the FBI, DHS, and the IACP convened the Tribal Information Sharing
Working Group (TISW), which identified eight major findings that hinder tribal
information sharing, and subsequently has developed recommendations for
improvement.</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The 2013 PM-ISE report, "Improving Suspicious Activity
  Reporting (SAR) Analysis," finds there are opportunities to further
  integrate SAR information into federal, state, and local intelligence analytic
  processes. PM-ISE is working with the ISA IPC SAR Subcommittee to address the
  findings and recommendations in the report.</p></li>
    <li><p>
  Federal Operation Centers need to adopt a common Request for Information
  (RFI) exchange process, and develop a common Alerts, Warnings, and Notifications
  (AWN) information exchange process, as well as information exchange
  protocols.</p></li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2><a href="#section-1" id="section-1">Law Enforcement and Homeland Security Information Sharing</a></h2>

  <h3><a href="#section-1a" id="section-1a">Joint Terrorism Task Forces (JTTFs)</a></h3>

  <p>The tactical edge of counterterrorism within
  the U.S. homeland remains the FBI's JTTF&mdash;a
  small cell of highly trained, locally based, committed investigators, analysts,
  linguists, SWAT experts, and other specialists drawn from federal, state, local, and
  tribal law enforcement and intelligence organizations.</p>

  <p>The first JTTF was established in New York
  City in 1980, but the years since 9/11 have seen a dramatic growth in the numbers and
  capabilities of JTTFs. Today, the JTTFs in 103 cities include more than 4,200
  members&mdash;more than four times the pre-9/11
  total&mdash;hailing from nearly 600 state and local agencies and 50
  federal agencies, most notably including the DHS, the U.S. military, Immigration and
  Customs Enforcement (ICE), and the Transportation Security Administration
  (TSA).</p>

  <p>JTTFs are a major counterterrorism asset as a
  result of the collaborative work, pooled knowledge, and specialized capabilities of
  their varied membership. They demonstrate the value that results from an environment
  in which information is shared freely, and in which action is supported by
  information drawn together from many sources.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-1b" id="section-1b">National Network of Fusion Centers</a></h3>

  <p>Located in states and major urban areas
  throughout the country, fusion centers empower front-line law enforcement, public
  safety, fire service, emergency response, public health, critical infrastructure
  protection owners and operators, and private-sector security personnel to understand
  local implications of national intelligence findings, enabling local officials to
  better protect their communities. As of March 2013, 78 designated state and major
  urban area fusion centers make up the National Network of Fusion Centers (National
  Network). Agency responses to the 2013 ISE Performance Assessment Questionnaire (ISE
  PAQ)<a href="#_ftn14" id="_ftnref14" title=""><sup>[14]</sup></a>indicate
  that 57% of federal agencies participate in the National Network; and that 68%
  incorporate fusion center information into their own products and
  services.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1c" id="section-1c">Continued Progress in Enhancing the Critical Operational Capabilities of the National Network of Fusion Centers</a></h4>

  <p>In accordance with national strategies and
  policy, the Federal Government has formalized processes for guiding support to fusion
  centers and evaluating their capabilities.<a href="#_ftn15" id="_ftnref15" title=""><sup>[15]</sup></a>
  In particular, DHS, in collaboration with fusion center directors
  and federal partners, has instituted a repeatable annual assessment
  process<a href="#_ftn16" id="_ftnref16" title=""><sup>[16]</sup></a>
  to measure the progress made by the National Network in maturing
  state and local intelligence processes and analytic capabilities.<a href="#_edn2" id="_ednref2" title=""><sup>[ii]</sup></a>This
  assessment aims to objectively evaluate information sharing by fusion centers and the
  National Network as a whole, while simultaneously providing valuable feedback on
  support provided by the Federal Government to help further develop and sustain the
  network.</p>

  <table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" class="table table-bordered table-striped">
 <tr>
  <td width="439" valign="top">
   <h5><a href="#section-1d" id="section-1d">Terrorist Screening Center(TSC)</a></h5>

   <p>The TSC reported that in a
   three"month
   period ending in August 2012 there were 214 cases of actionable or
   investigative intelligence developed and 60 new service requests generated
   through information provided by fusion centers to the TSC. By October 2012,
   there were 489 cases of actionable or investigative intelligence developed
   and 152 requests generated through information provided by fusion centers to
   the TSC.</p>
  </td>
 </tr>
   </table>

  <p>Progress has increased steadily since 2010.
  As of 2012, 97% of fusion centers identified counterterrorism as a core mission
  focus; 96% indicate that they apply an all-crimes approach; and 70% indicate they
  apply an all-hazards approach.<a href="#_ftn17" id="_ftnref17" title=""><sup>[17]</sup></a>
  In addition, as detailed in <a href="#_Ref363395997"><sup>[iii]</sup></a>and
  more than 92% of fusion centers have documented and approved plans, policies, or
  standard operating procedures for the four identified Critical Operational
  Capabilities (COC).<a href="#_edn4" id="_ednref4" title=""><sup>[iv]</sup></a></p>

  <p><img width="363" height="159" src="assets/img/image012.png" alt="Title: Figure: Continued Progress in Enhancing the Critical Operational Capabilities of the National Network of Fusion Centers - Description: Bar chart showing the continued progress in enhancing the critical operational capabilities of the National Network of Fusion Centers. 2010 BCA (09/2010) to 2011 Aessment (08/2011) to 2012 Aeessment (08/2012): COC 1 = 43% to 79% to 92% COC 2 = 28% to 76% to 94% COC 3 = 40% to 79% to 95% COC 4 = 56% to 81% to 94% P/CR/CL = 28% to 100% to 100%" /></p>
<p><small>Figure 1. Continued Progress in Enhancing the Critical Operational Capabilities of the National Network of Fusion Centers.</small></p>
  <p>To assist fusion centers in fully achieving and maintaining the four COC, DHS I&A has deployed more than 90 personnel, including Intelligence Officers and Regional Directors, to the field. I&A has worked aggressively to deploy the Homeland Secure Data Network (HSDN) to more than 65 fusion centers, <a href="#_edn5" id="_ednref5" title=""><sup>[v]</sup></a>enhancing
  information sharing at the SECRET level. In addition, the FBI strategy for fusion
  center engagement has resulted in 90 FBI personnel deployed to fusion centers and
  FBINet connectivity in approximately 45 of them.<a href="#_edn6" id="_ednref6" title=""><sup>[vi]</sup></a>DHS
  also established a maturity model for the National Network as part of the assessment
  program. This model identifies four stages&mdash;<em>fundamental,
  emerging, enhanced</em>, and
  <em>mature</em>&mdash;through which the National
  Network will progress as it moves towards full capability and operational integration
  as a unified system. As of February 2013, the National Network is in the second stage
  of the maturity model, with ongoing efforts to build and achieve full
  capacity.<a href="#_edn7" id="_ednref7" title=""><sup>[vii]</sup></a></p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1e" id="section-1e">Partner Activities</a></h4>

  <h5><a href="#section-1f" id="section-1f">Fusion Center Partnerships</a></h5>

  <p>In line with the recommendations in the
  recently released report, <em>Information Sharing: Agencies Could Better Coordinate to
  Reduce Overlap in Field-Based Activities (GAO-13-471)</em>,
  DHS continues to emphasize the importance of ongoing coordination and collaboration
  between fusion centers; FBI Field Intelligence Groups (FIGs); the High Intensity Drug
  Trafficking Areas (HIDTA) Program's Investigative Support Centers
  (ISC); the Regional Information Sharing Systems (RISS) Program's
  Centers; and major city and county intelligence units to support implementation of
  the statewide fusion process. To support these coordination efforts, DHS has
  sponsored 19 analytic exchanges between analysts from fusion centers, HIDTA ISCs,
  city and county intelligence units, and RISS centers since January 2012. The analytic
  exchanges promoted collaboration between analysts to share information, including
  state and local Requests for Information (RFI). Furthermore, the exchanges provided
  an opportunity to increase the quality of analytic products.<a href="#_edn8" id="_ednref8" title=""><sup>[viii]</sup></a></p>

  <h5><a href="#section-1g" id="section-1g">Fusion Liaison Officer Programs</a></h5>

  <p>On March 15, 2012, the National Fusion
  Liaison Officer (FLO) Program convened a workshop to facilitate the sharing of best
  practices and lessons learned between FLOs<a href="#_ftn18" id="_ftnref18" title=""><sup>[18]</sup></a>across
  the National Network. The workshop provided opportunities for facilitated discussion
  on ways to implement a bottom-up approach to standardize liaison officer programs
  across the National Network. The workshop findings included a recommendation that FLO
  program coordinators conduct regular conference calls, the first of which occurred on
  January 24, 2013. This national conference call was established to discuss current
  trends, best practices, and lessons learned from FLO programs across the National
  Network. This coordination not only improves communications between FLO program
  coordinators, but also provides opportunities to discuss common and consistent
  approaches to the operation of FLO programs.<a href="#_edn9" id="_ednref9" title=""><sup>[ix]</sup></a></p>

  <h5><a href="#section-1h" id="section-1h">Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties (P/CR/CL) Protections</a></h5>

  <p>Fusion centers develop, implement, and
  enforce P/CR/CL safeguards to protect constitutional rights, and to ensure that they
  are addressing their ethical and legal obligations while engaged in the fusion
  process. Their commitment to these safeguards builds trust with partners and the
  community, and fosters increased information sharing, which is vital to executing the
  fusion process. Fusion centers work to ensure that their personnel understand the
  importance of protecting P/CR/CL, and that intelligence systems are used in a manner
  that conforms to appropriate P/CR/CL protection protocols and regulations. For
  details on National Network P/CR/CL compliance and training, see Section 5 of this
  report<em>.</em></p>

  <h5><a href="#section-1i" id="section-1i">Joint Product Development Assistance Program</a></h5>

  <p>In 2012, as part of the DHS/DOJ Fusion
  Process Technical Assistance Program and Services, DHS facilitated the development of
  nine joint intelligence products between fusion centers that address
  cross-jurisdictional homeland security issues such as border-related crime,
  transnational organized crime, critical infrastructure assessments, and other
  strategic issues.<a href="#_ftn19" id="_ftnref19" title=""><sup>[19]</sup></a>, <a
  href="#_edn10" id="_ednref10" title=""><sup>[x]</sup></a>The
  collaboration necessary to develop joint products improves communication between
  fusion centers and partners in their areas of responsibility, including
  private-sector and public-safety entities. Furthermore, the relationships established
  during these projects build the foundation for future partnerships, which strengthens
  the fusion center network.</p>

  <h5><a href="#section-1j" id="section-1j">Field Analytic Support Task Force</a></h5>

  <p>On October 1, 2012, DHS I&amp;A established
  the Field Analytic Support Task Force (FAST). FAST is led by senior personnel from
  I&amp;A, and the State and Local Program Office (SLPO), and supported by analysts who
  are experienced in analysis and production from across I&amp;A. FAST advocates for
  the intelligence requirements of SLTT government agencies, and collaborates with
  federal partners to identify, develop, and share intelligence products
  with SLTT partners. It also manages and sponsors
  joint analysis and production efforts with fusion centers, with an emphasis on
  improving tailored, regionally-focused analysis. FAST ensures coordination with the
  NCTC, including access to intelligence community (IC) products and education of IC
  analysts on SLTT needs and requirements, promotes collaboration among analysts, and
  manages system advocacy and requirements generation.<a href="#_edn11" id="_ednref11" title=""><sup>[xi]</sup></a></p>

  <h5><a href="#section-1k" id="section-1k">Building Communities of Trust (BCOT)</a></h5>

  <p>The BCOT initiative is designed to encourage
  and improve information sharing among police officers, fusion centers, and the
  communities they serve&mdash;particularly immigrant and minority
  communities&mdash;to address the challenges of crime control and
  terrorism prevention. The knowledge and insight that comes from trust-based
  relationships between law enforcement and the community are critical because they
  allow law enforcement to better distinguish between innocent behaviors and behaviors
  that may be indicative of criminal activity. Through 2012, the Nationwide SAR
  Initiative (NSI) led implementation of BCOT efforts, culminating in a roundtable in
  December 2012. In January 2013, DHS, in collaboration with the NSI PMO; the office of
  the PM-ISE; DOJ's Office of Community Oriented Policing Services;
  and the U.S. Attorney's Office, took the lead in implementing the
  BCOT initiative across the country to help facilitate relationships of trust among
  local communities, local law enforcement, and fusion centers. DHS has committed to
  sponsoring 25 BCOT engagements across the country in the next year.<a href="#_edn12" id="_ednref12" title=""><sup>[xii]</sup></a></p>

  <h5><a href="#section-1l" id="section-1l">National Fusion Center Exercise (Fusion X)</a></h5>

  <p>As a key component of the Fusion Center
  Performance Program (FCPP), DHS I&amp;A conducts periodic exercises to evaluate the
  progress of fusion center capability development and performance. I&amp;A hosted the
  first exercise under the FCPP in August 2012. Federal agencies, including the FBI,
  and eight fusion centers participated in this exercise, which was called
  FUSION X. This exercise provided a valuable opportunity for fusion centers to
  operationally apply, demonstrate, and assess Critical Operating and Enabling
  Capabilities alongside National Network and federal partners in response to a
  regional threat scenario.<a href="#_edn13" id="_ednref13" title=""><sup>[xiii]</sup></a></p>

  <h3><a href="#section-1m" id="section-1m">Nationwide Suspicious Activity Reporting (SAR) Initiative (NSI)</a></h3>

  <p>
  <img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image014.png" alt="Title: NSI - Description: Nationwide SAR Initiative logo." class="left"  />The Nationwide Suspicious Activity
Reporting (SAR) Initiative (NSI) is a collaborative effort led by the DOJ Bureau of
Justice Assistance (BJA) in partnership with DHS, the FBI, and SLTT law enforcement
partners.<a href="#_ftn20" id="_ftnref20" title=""><sup>[20]</sup></a>The
  program's continued implementation and expansion beyond the law
  enforcement community is one of the priority objectives outlined in the National
  Strategy.</p>

  <p>The NSI is a tool to help prevent terrorism
  and other related criminal activity by creating a national capacity for gathering,
  documenting, processing, analyzing, and sharing SAR information. The NSI coordinates
  closely with the DHS "If You See Something, Say
  Something&trade;" campaign, a simple and effective program
  to raise public awareness of the indicators of terrorism and terrorism-related crime,
  and to encourage the reporting of suspicious activity to local law enforcement
  authorities.</p>

  <p>Over the past year, the NSI PMO continued to
  implement the standards, policies, and processes of the NSI across the National
  Network. As of June 2013, 78 fusion centers have the capability to contribute and
  share suspicious activity reports, expanding the reach of the NSI to more than 14,000
  law enforcement agencies in all 50 states, as well as the District of Columbia,
  Puerto Rico, and the Virgin Islands.<a href="#_edn14" id="_ednref14" title=""><sup>[xiv]</sup></a>
  To date, more than 35,000 SAR entries have been submitted by
  stakeholders to the NSI, and tens of thousands of queries have been made by
  investigators and analysts. The entries have been successfully leveraged from an
  investigative perspective by the FBI, and analysts are utilizing this information to
  advance their situational awareness, and to produce intelligence products related to
  suspicious activity reporting.<a href="#_edn15" id="_ednref15" title=""><sup>[xv]</sup></a></p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1n" id="section-1n">A Unified Message for SAR</a></h4>

  <p>This year the NSI PMO worked with the
  International Association of Chiefs of Police (IACP) and other state, local, and
  federal partners to develop the Unified Message document, titled <em>A Call to
  Action:</em> A Unified Message Regarding the Need to Support
  Suspicious Activity Reporting and Training. This document
  emphasizes the importance of reporting suspicious activities; stresses the importance
  of SAR training and tells agencies where they can receive it; discusses the role of
  fusion centers, FBI Field Intelligence Groups (FIG), and FBI JTTFs in analyzing and
  investigating SAR; and encourages agencies at all levels of government to work with
  the DHS on its "If You See Something, Say
  Something&trade;" campaign.<a href="#_ftn21" id="_ftnref21" title=""><sup>[21]</sup></a>The
  IACP and PM-ISE are sponsoring a Unified Message Task Team (UMTT), which uses the
  Unified Message to enhance SAR training for law enforcement agencies. The UMTT is
  also promoting efforts to incorporate Terrorist Screening Center (TSC) efforts into
  the unified message, to improve SAR metrics, and to develop and distribute model
  policies to local law enforcement agencies in order to institutionalize and
  operationalize the reporting of SAR.<a href="#_edn16" id="_ednref16" title=""><sup>[xvi]</sup></a></p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1o" id="section-1o">Improving SAR Analysis</a></h4>

  <p>In late 2012, the office of the PM-ISE, in
  consultation with the NSI PMO, the FBI, the Federal Government, and SLTT partners,
  examined the implementation of the current ISE-SAR Functional Standard to identify
  gaps, challenges, and opportunities in analyzing ISE-SAR information.<a href="#_edn17" id="_ednref17" title=""><sup>[xvii]</sup></a>The
  findings and recommendations of the review are intended to assist program managers
  with completing implementation of NSI programs across the National Network of Fusion
  Centers and the Federal Government, and seamlessly integrate ISE-SAR information into
  analytic processes and potentially subsequent investigations by FBI JTTF
  personnel.</p>

  <p>Overall, the review found that significant
  progress was made over the past two years to help analysts incorporate ISE-SAR
  information into their analytic workflow. However, opportunities exist to further
  leverage ISE-SAR information. For instance, the inability to download or import
  ISE-SAR data from the NSI Federated Search Tool and eGuardian limits fusion center
  analysts' ability to seamlessly integrate this information into
  their analytic processes. This limitation, which is by design, is intended to ensure
  that originators of ISE-SAR data are able to keep this information up-to-date, as
  well as to ensure that proper access controls are in place, and that privacy, civil
  rights, and civil liberties (P/CR/CL) protections are maintained. Any course of
  action to overcome this limitation would necessarily have to possess at least the
  same levels of data integrity, access control, and P/CR/CL protections as currently
  exist.</p>

  <p>The review identified other noteworthy
  challenges. Fusion center analysts recommended that the behaviors listed in Part B of
  the ISE-SAR Functional Standard should be updated to bring the document up to date
  with current analysis of behaviors and indicators of violent extremism and
  mobilization to violence. In addition, several analysts lamented that a lack of a
  shared understanding of the value that intelligence analysis brings to strategic
  planning and decisionmaking contributes to analytic capability shortfalls. The review
  found that intelligence analysis processes are not part of the law enforcement
  agencies' "gold standard" for
  accreditation.</p>

  <p>Based on the findings, PM-ISE made
  the following recommendations for ISE-SAR analysis:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>
  The ISA IPC SAR Subcommittee should consider establishing a SAR Analytic
  Working Group, composed of federal and SLTT analysts, to review the existing overall
  NSI Concept of Operations (CONOP), and to jointly develop a more focused analysis
  CONOP to more clearly articulate its roles, responsibilities, and
  expectations;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The SAR Subcommittee should explore various solutions that may be offered
  as shared services for responsibly, reliably, and repeatedly correlating ISE-SAR and
  other law enforcement and criminal intelligence data through national data
  exchanges;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The ISE-SAR analysis training should be enhanced by presenting a menu of
  approaches for processing, analyzing, and disseminating ISE-SARs, making it a more
  practical course with components that can be incorporated wholly or in part into the
  workflow of fusion centers and federal agencies;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The SAR Subcommittee should conduct a comprehensive stakeholder analysis to
  identify governance gaps for the NSI; take the necessary steps to fill these gaps;
  and raise to the attention of the ISA IPC any issues with filling governance
  shortfalls;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The SAR Subcommittee should convene a panel of federal, state, and local
  subject matter experts to review the criteria listed in Part B of the ISE-SAR
  functional standard to determine if it should be updated;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The SAR Subcommittee and the P/CL Subcommittee of the ISA IPC should
  jointly support the NSI PMO efforts for reviewing compliance of ISE-SAR reporting
  with the functional standard across the entire ISE; and</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The SAR Subcommittee should evaluate the need to develop and implement an
  end-to-end comprehensive performance framework that enables programmatic decisions by
  providing key information on an ongoing basis for evaluating ISE-SAR integration into
  analytic processes and potential subsequent investigation by FBI JTTFs (for those
  SARs with a terrorism nexus).</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a href="#section-1p" id="section-1p">eGuardian and NSI Shared-Space Interoperability and Enhancements</a></h4>

  <p>The FBI's eGuardian system
  was developed to help meet the challenges of collecting and sharing potential
  terrorism-related SARs amongst law enforcement agencies across various jurisdictions.
  eGuardian allows law enforcement agencies to combine new SARs with existing (legacy)
  SAR reporting systems to form a single information repository accessible to thousands
  of law enforcement personnel. The information captured in eGuardian is migrated to
  the FBI's internal Guardian system, where it is assigned to the
  appropriate JTTF for further investigative action. The FBI enhanced its internal
  Guardian system to be able to push unclassified Guardian incidents to eGuardian in
  2010. To date, more than 18,534 incidents have been shared with eGuardian and the NSI
  Shared Spaces.</p>

   following the April 15, 2013 Boston Marathon bombing, the FBI utilized
   Guardian to facilitate a flow of leads and tips generated by FBI field
   offices, state and local police forces, and the public. The Guardian system
   enabled more complete and comprehensive analysis of all the available
   information in support of national-level decisionmaking.</p>

   <p>The FBI Counterterrorism
   Division's Guardian Management Unit (GMU) monitored and
   coordinated the flow of information received by the Guardian system, and
   assured users that pertinent information on the bombing was being
   shared.</p>

   <p>Supporting the investigation, GMU
   identified and reported 177 Guardian incidents relevant to the investigation;
   those leads were generated not only from the internal Guardian system, but
   also from eGuardian. The leads enabled direct reporting of relevant
   information to the FBI for additional assessment.</p>

   <p>Information sharing between the FBI
   and the public was vital to the Boston Bombings investigation. After a press
   conference on April 18, the FBI received more than 5,700 tips on that day
   alone, and approximately 15,000 tips in the days following, which enabled the
   FBI to generate 119 Guardian leads for assessment.</p>

   <p>After the initial investigation, the
   FBI expanded its review of incidents containing information possibly related
   to the bombing.</p>

  <p><strong>Shared Space to eGuardian</strong>
  Auto-Push A significant accomplishment this past year was
  the institutionalization of an automatic transfer of information from the NSI Shared
  Space to eGuardian. As 50 fusion centers use the Shared Space technology, it is vital
  to ensure that the information being submitted and shared via the Shared Space is
  also being actively sent to the FBI for assessment. The NSI PMO technology team
  worked closely with the FBI and the fusion centers to help realize this goal by the
  end of March 2013, and the auto-push feature is now employed in all fusion centers
  using the Shared Space technology.<a href="#_edn18" id="_ednref18" title=""><sup>[xviii]</sup></a></p>

  <p><strong>New eGuardian Geospatial Tools</strong>
  Standard map controls were delivered last year. This gives users
  the ability to zoom and pan on eGuardian's dynamic map display, to
  click on an incident to display core incident data, and to link to the full incident
  report. Additionally, a new query capability gives users the ability to filter their
  incident display by state and incident type.</p>

  <p><strong>eGuardian Cyber Incident Update</strong>
  eGuardian users can now submit incidents that contain cyber attack
  and cyber victim information. These cyber incidents are transmitted to the FBI,
  similar to the process for transmitting incidents related to terrorism.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1r" id="section-1r">SAR in Federal Agencies</a></h4>

  <p>A rollout plan to formalize the sharing of
  SAR information currently taking place between federal agencies is under development.
  This plan will ensure that federal SAR information sharing processes mirror those
  within the National Network. The implementation of the federal plan involves the
  identification of those federal agencies with law enforcement personnel; outreach to
  the executive management of those agencies to gain the necessary support and
  participation in the NSI; and the execution of a SAR process. The approach also
  includes the incorporation of the eGuardian system as the technology solution; NSI
  Line Officer Training; SAR Analytic Training; and adherence to a privacy policy. As
  of January 2013, 56 federal agencies, representing 226 individual
  organizations,<a href="#_ftn22" id="_ftnref22" title=""><sup>[22]</sup></a>are
  in various stages of participation with the NSI, and four additional agencies that

   <h5><a href="#section-1s" id="section-1s">Bank Secrecy Act Suspicious Activity Reports</a></h5>

   <p>The Bank Secrecy Act (BSA), as
   amended by the USA PATRIOT Act, establishes important reporting requirements
   for certain financial institutions to help authorities follow the money when
   tracking illicit actions. These required reports include BSA Suspicious
   Activity Reports (BSA SAR). BSA SARs are a specific kind of suspicious
   activity report, distinct from the NSI, that have proved essential in
   identifying, investigating, and interdicting terrorist activity in the United
   States.</p>

   <p>Financial institutions file BSA SARs
   with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, a bureau of the Department of
   the Treasury, which makes the information available to appropriate
   authorities for their investigative and analytical work. BSA SARs highlight
   suspicious behavior based on indicators of potential criminal activity. The
   form includes a section for filers to specify whether the activity is
   believed to be associated with terrorist financing and can help investigators
   and analysts detect a terrorist cell.</p>

   <p>Another report, the currency
   transaction report (CTR), is filed by certain financial institutions whenever
   a customer transaction involves more than $10,000 in cash, including related
   cash transactions over the course of a day that aggregate to more than
   $10,000. Rather than a subjective analysis of financial behavior, the CTR
   documents specific transactions and patterns of activity that may lead to a
   crucial piece of evidence. The FBI reports that, as of June 2012, 37% of
   their pending counter-terrorism cases have associated BSA reports, and more
   than 90% of those counter-terrorism BSA reports are CTRs.<a  href="#_ftn23" id="_ftnref23" title=""><sup>[23]</sup></a></p>

  <h3><a href="#section-1t" id="section-1t">Joint Counterterrorism Assessment Team</a></h3>

  <p>On April 1, 2013, NCTC, DHS, and the FBI
  established the Joint Counterterrorism Assessment Team (JCAT) as the successor
  organization to the Interagency Threat Assessment and Coordination Group (ITACG). The
  ITACG was established in 2007 under the Implementing Recommendations of the 9/11
  Commission Act to integrate, analyze, and assist in the dissemination of
  federally-coordinated information within the scope of the ISE, including homeland
  security information, terrorism information, and weapons of mass destruction (WMD)
  information. Given the expiration of appropriations for ITACG in FY 2012, NCTC
  collaborated with its partners to build upon the ITACG model to ensure that NCTC,
  DHS, and the FBI continue to meet the CT mission needs of SLTT partners.</p>

  <p>The JCAT is a joint, interagency activity
  within the NCTC Directorate of Operations Support (NCTC/DOS), with NCTC, DHS, and the
  FBI sharing staff and other resources. Unlike the ITACG, which was led by a Senior
  DHS Officer, the JCAT Director position is a rotational billet that can be filled by
  an officer from any of the three organizations when appointed by the NCTC Director.
  An NCTC officer will serve as the first JCAT Director. In addition, there are two
  deputies, both senior officials from DHS and FBI initially. Under the ITACG, there
  was a single deputy, a senior FBI officer.</p>

  <p>Going forward, the
  JCAT's primary mission is to research, draft, and collaborate with
  NCTC, DHS, and the FBI for the joint production of counterterrorism and terrorism
  intelligence for federal, SLTT, and private-sector partners.<a
  href="#_edn19" id="_ednref19" title=""><sup>[xix]</sup></a>This
  is a change from the ITACG, which was mandated by law only to integrate, analyze, and
  assist in the dissemination of federally-coordinated information. The JCAT, like the
  ITACG, will also advocate for the intelligence requirements of the SLTT partners and
  the private sector, and will work to foster an understanding of SLTT and
  private-sector intelligence needs throughout the Intelligence Community
  (IC).<a href="#_ftn24" id="_ftnref24" title=""><sup>[24]</sup></a><sup>,

  <p>In 2013, at the request of the NCTC/DOS, the office of the PM­‐ISE assisted the JCAT in refining
their understanding of SLTT partner information requirements and integrating these
requirements into the JCAT’s standard operating procedures. JCAT is also working closely with the
National Intelligence Manager for Counterterrorism (NIM-‐CT) to integrate and align with IC­‐wide
counterterrorism management frameworks, including the NIM‐CT’s annual counterterrorism
production guidance and performance reviews.</p>
  <h4><a href="#section-1u" id="section-1u">MEASURING JCAT PERFORMANCE</a></h4>
  <p>NCTC leadership requires evaluative information to assist them in effectively managing the JCAT.
The information should tell them whether, and in what ways, the JCAT is working well, which
ways it is not working well, and in both cases why. The purpose of measuring JCAT performance is
to promote increased efficiency and effectiveness of the program and ultimately, improved
information sharing and enhanced public safety. The PM‐ISE is assisting NCTC in developing a
comprehensive framework, which will be in place to support the next full round of ISE
performance reporting requirements in the spring of 2014.</p>
<h4><a href="#section-1v" id="section-1v">DOMESTIC INFORMATION SHARING ENVIRONMENTS</a></h4>
<p>Shrinking budgets, dynamic threats, and exploding amounts of data are all significant challenges
for the homeland security and law enforcement communities today. Building efficient and
effective information sharing environments at the state and local levels using the tools and
lessons learned from federal efforts is helping to solve these challenges. Each state, of course, has
unique requirements, but states are realizing good results by building ISEs based on best
practices.</p>
  <p>The call to action for these efforts is the Global Justice Sharing Initiative’s (Global) <em>Strategic
  	Solutions to Transform Our Nation’s Justice and Public Safety Information Sharing</em>.<a id="_ftnref25" href="#_ftn25"><sup>[25]</sup></a> Released
  in November 2012, this document challenges governors, sheriffs, chiefs of police, and
  other Global Advisory Committee (GAC) members to develop single-sign-on (SSO) and
  federated query capabilities; leverage secure cloud solutions; develop and engage in
  shared services and systems; ensure interoperability between law enforcement
  deconfliction systems; advance information sharing to support successful reentry of
  formerly incarcerated individuals; and collaborate with federal partners to
  coordinate a consistent approach to federal funding, policy support, and universal
  adoption of common standards and technologies.</p>

  <p>States are responding to the call and are
  realizing benefits. The New York State Police moved from an antiquated mainframe to a
  service-oriented architecture, reducing costs and improving response time. New York
  also employed the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) to standardize their
  data exchanges and deploy a system that is more interoperable with other
  public-safety databases. And the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority is
  bringing together practitioners, program managers, and technologists from federal,
  state, and local governments to establish an Illinois ISE that connects information
  responsibly and effectively.<a href="#_edn21" id="_ednref21" title=""><sup>[xxi]</sup></a></p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1w" id="section-1w">New Jersey Information Sharing Environment</a></h4>

  <p>In February 2012, the Integrated Justice
  Information Systems (IJIS) Institute technology assessment of the New Jersey Regional
  Operations and Intelligence Center (NJ ROIC) provided recommendations for building an
  integrated information sharing enterprise that would place the NJ ROIC in a unique
  position to drive and help sustain an information sharing environment within the
  state. Coordinated by the Police Institute at Rutgers University, with IJIS
  involvement in leading the development of the standards-based architecture and
  technology components, this effort is now underway and is a national model for
  linking state law enforcement agencies with fusion centers.<a
  href="#_edn22" id="_ednref22" title=""><sup>[xxii]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The New Jersey Information Sharing
  Environment (NJ ISE) Initiative will ensure the expeditious transmittal and receipt
  of the information and intelligence needed to make better decisions about public
  safety challenges by:</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>Enabling the free flow of
  	information</strong> in support of statewide law enforcement,
  homeland security, and emergency management to prevent, mitigate, respond to,
  investigate, and recover from manmade and natural or disasters;</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>Providing secure access to
  	information</strong> and actionable intelligence for participating
  agencies, across the public and private sectors, to better assure the safety and
  security of New Jersey communities;</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>Providing network, data, and
  	application services</strong> in a trusted, Internet-based
  federation, in conformance with national standards for information sharing and
  safeguarding; and</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>Optimizing investment</strong>
  through the use and reuse of business and technological frameworks
  that have been effectively implemented in state and national initiatives.</p>

  <p>This progression to a statewide ISE
  puts powerful analytic tools that traditionally were only accessible at the Fusion
  Center into the hands of remote users and makes data that was once unavailable to
  those outside of a local precinct office discoverable and retrievable to the
  enterprise as a whole.</p>

  <p>At the heart of the NJ ISE initiative is the
  intention of sharing critical information with key partners at the local, county,
  state, and federal levels&mdash;in a timely, cost-effective, and
  design-efficient manner. This solution will provide analysts, field operators,
  investigators, and chief executives with the information and intelligence they need
  to enhance overall public safety efforts.</p>

  (IDEx) is a 21-agency effort that includes federal, state, and local association
  participation. Launched as a proof-of-concept in August 2011 under the Indiana
  Department of Homeland Security's leadership, it seeks to connect
  data from disparate justice and public safety systems for the purpose of enhanced
  decisionmaking and increased public safety by leveraging prior investments. Using
  federal grants, national data sharing models and standards (i.e. NIEM), and reusing
  common information exchange languages, the state is reducing development costs as
  more agencies request the same data from a common system.<a href="#_ftn26" id="_ftnref26" title=""><sup>[26]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The state could potentially save
  approximately $2 million in upfront IT development costs and an additional $3 million
  annually in business cost avoidance from gained process efficiencies.<a href="#_ftn27" id="_ftnref27" title=""><sup>[27]</sup></a>
  A return on investment report for IDEx concludes that
  "<em>there are significant benefits&mdash;both from a
  true cost savings and from a business process/operational
  savings</em>&mdash;<em>in making this investment.</em>
  Ultimately, it also increases effectiveness and efficiency of
  government services by placing the right information in the right

  <h4><a href="#section-1y" id="section-1y">Connect South Dakota</a></h4>

  <p>South Dakota state law enforcement, city
  police departments, and county sheriffs have traditionally used a variety of systems
  to manage records and jail information. Until recently, these systems were largely
  isolated from each other, preventing statewide information sharing. A low-cost
  solution for statewide information sharing that could incorporate jurisdictions, many
  with small budgets and few officers, was required.</p>

  <p>Using a grant from the DOJ BJA to build the
  servers and licenses; standards from Global; and with acquisition assistance from the
  IJIS Institute, South Dakota built the backbone of <em>Connect South
  Dakota</em>. Their systems now use NIEM to standardize data
  exchanges&mdash;providing a secure login environment using role-based
  permissions through a RISS implementation of the Global Federated Identity and
  Privilege Management (GFIPM) project.<a href="#_edn23" id="_ednref23" title=""><sup>[xxiii]</sup></a></p>

  Dakota plans to continue adding partners
  from the Departments of Corrections, Parole, and Probation, as well as sworn tribal
  officers in South Dakota; and will grant access to agencies regardless of whether
  their jurisdiction submits information. <em>Connect South Dakota Phase
  2</em> will add a web-based Records Management System (RMS)
  feature for smaller jurisdictions, many of whom use localized databases or pay for
  vendor solutions.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-1z" id="section-1z">Tribal Law Enforcement Information Sharing</a></h3>

  <p>There are more than 2,300 tribal law
  enforcement officers in 171 tribal police agencies and 37 Bureau of Indian Affairs
  (BIA) agencies, for a total of 208 agencies associated with the 564 federally
  recognized tribes in the United States. As noted in last year's
  report, through Federal Government support, and in cooperation with state and local
  partners, tribal law enforcement personnel are integrated into several fusion
  centers. However, as noted last year, there continue to be recognized gaps in tribal
  information sharing. The variety of challenges include lack of resources; reluctance
  of some states to allow tribal law enforcement access to federal and state databases;
  tribal reluctance to engage with outside law enforcement entities; and insufficient
  training on the use of fusion center resources.<a href="#_edn24" id="_ednref24" title=""><sup>[xxiv]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In 2013, PM-ISE, in coordination
  with BIA, DOJ's Office of Tribal Justice (OTJ), the NCTC, the FBI,
  DHS, and the IACP convened the Tribal Information Sharing Working Group (TISW) to
  examine the challenges that exist in justice and public safety information sharing in
  Indian Country. As of April 2013, the TISW has identified the following eight major
  findings that hinder tribal information sharing, and has developed recommendations
  for improvement:</p>
  <ol>
  	<li><p>Tribal law enforcement participation in fusion centers is an area for improvement,
  and can be enhanced in a variety of ways;</p></li>
  	<li><p>Some states operate outside the goals of the Tribal Law and Order Act;</p></li>
  	<li><p>Tribal access to national and state information databases is hampered;</p></li>
  	<li><p>More tribal law enforcement entities should have access to the International Justice
  and Public Safety Network (Nlets);</p></li>
  	<li><p>The NSI program has been effective in tribal law enforcement efforts, and federally
  recognized tribes currently have full access to SARs with no impediments;</p></li>
  	<li><p>Some states do not recognize tribal law enforcement as <em>bona fide</em>

  preliminary meetings with DOJ, DOJ/FBI, and DHS/Customs and Border Protection, as
  members of a tribal subcommittee, to establish a framework for information sharing
  considerations and collaboration of federal law enforcement agencies and tribal law
  enforcement agencies. The preliminary meetings led to a more comprehensive executive
  meeting with DOJ, DOJ/FBI, OTJ, BIA, and CBP, to consider action items enhancing
  information sharing in Indian Country resulting in coordinated law enforcement
  efforts.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-1A" id="section-1A">Combating Human Trafficking</a></h3>

  <p>There has been considerable attention within
  the domestic and international law enforcement and intelligence communities focused
  on the probability that international terrorist groups exploit existing criminal
  trafficking networks. The same ISE capabilities that are being implemented to enable
  the sharing of terrorism-related information can be leveraged to improve the
  nation's capacity to combat human trafficking.</p>

  <p>DHS, through fusion centers, is helping
  state and local partners identify and report human trafficking indicators to federal
  law enforcement. Additionally, the IC is developing an all-source intelligence
  collection strategy for human trafficking to provide actionable intelligence to
  increase the number of domestic and international trafficking
  prosecutions.Through efforts like these, the ISE will
  continue to make a substantial contribution to improving our capacity to combat
  modern forms of slavery as well as the potential for terrorist exploitation of
  trafficking networks.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-1B" id="section-1B">Southeast Law Enforcement and Homeland Security Human Trafficking Symposium</a></h4>

  <p>The DHS I&amp;A SLPO, in partnership with
  the Georgia Bureau of Investigation and the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement
  (ICE) Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) Atlanta field office, hosted the
  Southeast Law Enforcement and Homeland Security Human Trafficking Symposium in
  Atlanta, Georgia, on August 8-9, 2012. Approximately 70 local,
  state, and federal participants attended and discussed emerging issues related to
  human trafficking in the southeastern U.S. The symposium provided an important
  opportunity for local, state, and federal entities involved with combating and
  preventing human trafficking to discuss issues in their respective areas of
  responsibility. The symposium encouraged dialogue, facilitated information exchange,
  accelerated the sharing of best practices, and enabled discussion of next steps among
  local, state, and federal participants.</p>

  February 2012 and scheduled for full operational capability in the summer of 2014, the NGI Facial Recognition Pilot permits
  authorized law enforcement agencies to submit queries for a facial recognition search
  of the FBI's national repository of approximately 15.3 million
  criminal mug shots. Query requests are automated, and the results are returned to the
  submitting agency as an investigative lead in the form of a ranked candidate list.
  Michigan, Maryland, and Texas are currently using the Facial Recognition Pilot to
  submit facial recognition searches to Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS).
  Memorandums of Understanding (MOU) have been executed with Hawaii, New Mexico, Ohio,
  South Carolina, Maine, Nebraska, Washington, DC Metro, and Tennessee. Minnesota and

  <h3><a href="#section-1J" id="section-1J">Standardizing Requests for Information</a></h3>

  <p>DHS is the primary federal source of
  accurate, actionable, and timely homeland security-related information for its
  federal, SLTT, and private sector partners. To carry out this mission, the DHS Office
  of Operations Coordination and Planning (OPS) provides situational awareness and a
  common operating picture through its National Operations Center, which fuses law
  enforcement, intelligence, emergency response, private-sector and open-source
  reporting, and shares this information through the Homeland Security Information
  Network.<a href="#_edn29" id="_ednref29" title=""><sup>[xxix]</sup></a>DHS
  I&amp;A accesses, receives, and analyzes law enforcement, intelligence, and other
  information, and integrates it into intelligence products that are shared internally
  and with DHS partners at all levels.</p>

  <p>DHS OPS and I&amp;A have developed a
  standardized business process, the Single Point of Service (SPS), to ensure that all
  operational and intelligence RFIs are reviewed, validated, and facilitated to the
  appropriate DHS organizations, as well as to federal, state, and local
  partners.<a href="#_edn30" id="_ednref30" title=""><sup>[xxx]</sup></a>
  As part of the DHS-SPS process, OPS and I&amp;A have been working
  with the Office of the Chief Information Officer to develop and deploy an automated
  RFI Management Tool (RMT) at the Sensitive but Unclassified level. The RMT will serve
  as OPS and I&amp;A's system of record for recording, tracking, and
  facilitating requests, including the associated oversight and review process. RMT
  will provide users with visibility into the RFI process by enabling them to obtain
  the status and location of their organization's RFIs, submit
  feedback, obtain performance management (metrics) reporting, and request access to
  RFIs submitted by other organizations.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-1K" id="section-1K">DHS Analytical Framework for Intelligence</a></h3>

  <p>In FY 2013, ICE partnered with U.S. Customs
  and Border Protection (CBP) to replace the capabilities of ICE's
  Intelligence Fusion System (IFS) with the CBP-run platform Analytical Framework for
  Intelligence (AFI). AFI allows for increased analytic collaboration, cooperation, and
  efficiencies by providing a full suite of tools designed to enhance all-source data
  consolidation, research, intelligence analysis, reporting, and production management.
  After AFI was identified as ICE's solution for these capabilities,
  ICE and CBP began to work together as an integrated team to bring in additional data
  sources to the AFI platform and deploy the application to approximately 5,000 ICE
  users at all 26 major field offices. The adoption of AFI by ICE and the consolidation
  of data sources will result in operations cost savings of nearly $3 million per
  year.</p>

  <p>By extending the AFI platform to ICE, both
  ICE and CBP will begin to share intelligence and a variety of data sources that have
  previously only been available in disparate systems. AFI will become the central
  platform where the data will be available to both components as well as other
  partners within DHS. Plans to extend AFI to U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services
  (CIS), TSA, and the USCG are in progress. As additional components join, the
  information sharing and collaborative intelligence environment will become more
  robust, resulting in better intelligence products, research capabilities, and
  investigative insights.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-2b" id="section-2b">North American Day (NAD) Pilot Programs</a></h3>

  <p>The United States, Canada, and Mexico
  annually participate in the North American Day (NAD) conference to exchange ideas
  about improving information technology issues of common concern among the three
  countries. During the July 2011 NAD conference, delegations from each country signed
  a trilateral MOU, and established information sharing pilot projects to conduct
  trilateral test data exchanges for public health alerts and stolen vehicle
  information issues based on common processes and framework standards. The purpose of
  the pilots was to demonstrate consistent and repeatable information sharing among the
  three countries without having to rely upon ad-hoc or point-to-point
  interfaces.</p>

  provided the CIOs from Canada, Mexico, and the United States with a venue in which to
  discuss the results of the two trilateral pilot projects for information exchange.
  The Public Health pilot focused on exchanging aggregated health alerts concerning
  food-borne illness outbreaks, and successfully exchanged real-time, aggregated,
  public health alerts among the three countries. Results and lessons learned are
  currently being documented to share with the public health community and the World
  Health Organization, as is a roadmap for moving the pilot to full production. The
  Public Safety pilot is ongoing and is focused on trilateral exchanges of information
  about stolen vehicles that cross the borders of the three countries.<a href="#_edn31" id="_ednref31" title=""><sup>[xxxi]</sup></a>
  A trilateral working group has conducted a technical demonstration
  and test exchange between the United States and Canada, and is nearing completion on
  a text exchange with Mexico.</p>

  <p>In addition to exploring approaches to
  operationalizing the exchanges, the three countries are pursuing opportunities for
  future collaboration. These include Canada's adoption of or
  participation in an Open Government Platform (OGPL)&mdash;the
  open-source version of Data.gov software developed by the United States and
  India&mdash;as the basis of its new open data portal, <a href="http://www.data.gc.ca/">data.gc.ca</a>;

  <h3><a href="#section-3a" id="section-3a">Addressing the 2012 NIAC Report Findings</a></h3>

  <p>In 2012 the PM-ISE championed a
  collaborative effort with DHS and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence
  (ODNI) to address gaps in intelligence and information sharing with the
  private-sector critical infrastructure and key resource owners and operators. The
  initiative began in October 2012, and is focused on integrating private-sector
  requirements and equities into existing processes of the ISE; increasing
  participation by the private sector in the ISE; and extending the existing
  capabilities, frameworks, and approaches that are centered on federal, state, local,
  and tribal agencies to support improvements in Critical Infrastructure and Key
  Resources (CIKR) information sharing with the private sector.<a
  href="#_edn33" id="_ednref33" title=""><sup>[xxxiii]</sup></a>
  In addition, the Administration has taken a number of steps to
  address several of the NIAC report findings and recommendations, some of which we
  highlight below.</p>

  <h5><a href="#section-3b" id="section-3b">NIAC Recommendations 1 and 2</a></h5>

  <p>Assert the priority of infrastructure
  protection and resiliency in national security; Improve implementation of existing
  authorities.</p>

  <h5><a href="#section-3c" id="section-3c">Federal Government Response</a></h5>

  <p>The Administration released three
  national-level policy directives that reinforce information sharing with critical
  infrastructure stakeholders, and boost security and resiliency as a national
  priority.<a href="#_edn34" id="_ednref34" title=""><sup>[xxxiv]</sup></a>These
  policies' complementary goals provide the foundation for
  strengthening the resiliency of the critical infrastructure of the United States
  through partnership and collaboration between government and the private
  sector.</p>

  <p><strong>The National Strategy for Information
  	Sharing and Safeguarding</strong>, released in
  December 2012,specifies the need to "establish information sharing processes and sector specific
  protocols with private sector partners to improve information quality and
  timeliness" as a priority.</p>

  <p><strong>Presidential Policy Directive
  	(PPD)-21</strong>, released in February
  2013, establishes national policy on critical infrastructure security and resilience,
  and establishes a shared responsibility among federal, state, local, tribal and
  territorial entities as well as public and private owners and operators of critical
  infrastructure. This directive also seeks to refine and clarify the functions, roles,
  and responsibility related to critical infrastructure protection across the Federal
  Government.</p>

  <p><strong>Executive Order (EO)
  	13636</strong>, released in February 2013,
  directs increases in the volume, timeliness, and quality of
  cyberthreat information shared with private-sector entities for the purpose of
  improving the security and resiliency of our nation's critical
  infrastructure against evolving physical and cyber threats and hazards.</p>

  <p>DHS is the Federal
  Government's lead agency for coordinating efforts to implement EO
  13636 and PPD-21. It has formed an interagency task force comprised of nine working
  groups to engage the Federal Government, SLTT governments, and private-sector
  partners in implementing the policies' major deliverables, and
  plans for these policies to be substantially implemented within one year. The major
  information sharing objectives and deliverables of these executive policies parallel
  the findings and recommendations of the NIAC report.</p>

  <h5><a href="#section-3d" id="section-3d">NIAC Recommendations 3, 4, and 6</a></h5>

  <p>Improve information content by leveraging
  partner capabilities; Improve the value of information products to risk management;
  Capitalize on private sector capabilities for counter-terrorism product
  solutions.</p>

  <h5><a href="#section-3e" id="section-3e">Federal Government Response</a></h5>

  <p>The DHS National Protection and Programs
  Directorate (NPPD) Office of Infrastructure Protection (IP) and DHS I&amp;A launched
  three targeted initiatives designed to incorporate the knowledge and expertise of
  CIKR owners and operators.</p>

  <p><strong>Leveraging Cross-Sector Capability</strong>
  - DHS established a working group of
  cross-sector representatives to assess the relevance of intelligence data and its
  usefulness to CIKR owners and operators across multiple sectors. Following a
  successful pilot, DHS developed a concept of operations to implement the
  capability.</p>

  <p><strong>Increasing Private-Sector Access to Relevant
  	Fusion Center Products</strong> - DHS began
  developing an enterprise-wide approach to efficiently make relevant fusion center
  analytic products available to the private sector via the Homeland Security
  Information Network (HSIN) and its Critical Infrastructure Community of
  Interest.</p>

  <p><strong>Leveraging Private Sector Owner and Operator
  	Expertise</strong> - In the summer of 2012, DHS
  and the Department of Energy (DOE) sponsored a classified cyber-threat briefing for
  Chief Executive Officers of electric utilities from across the nation. This led to a
  major executive-level industry initiative to identify the requirements and dedicate
  the necessary resources to address this sector-specific cyber-threat. Additionally,
  in March 2013, DHS began developing a process to engage appropriate CIKR stakeholders
  in the development of DHS analytical products prior to their dissemination to
  private-sector partners. This process is designed to increase the quality and
  usefulness of strategic analytic products by ensuring that they reflect
  private-sector requirements and concerns.</p>

  <h5><a href="#section-3f" id="section-3f">NIAC Recommendations 4 and 5</a></h5>

  <p>Improve the value of information products to
  risk management; Build accepted practices for timely information delivery.</p>

  <h5><a href="#section-3g" id="section-3g">Federal Government Response</a></h5>

  <p>In the last year, DHS NPPD IP migrated the
  Homeland Security Information Network and its Critical Infrastructure Community of

  <p>Holistic thinking about security and risk
  management is more important today than ever before. Understanding the cascading
  effects of cyber threats on physical infrastructure assets is the centerpiece of a
  capability being piloted at DHS through the HITRAC's Integrated
  Analysis Task Force (IATF). The IATF is comprised of participants from across NPPD
  components, including the HITRAC Program, Cybersecurity &amp; Communications, and
  Federal Protective Services.</p>

  <p>In 2012, the IATF conducted a
  proof-of-concept pilot with the city of Charlotte, North Carolina. The IATF worked
  with stakeholders from the commercial facilities sector, the Charlotte Office of the
  Chief Information Officer, and the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Emergency Management Office
  to assess participant cybersecurity postures, and to mitigate the physical
  consequences flowing from exploited cyber vulnerabilities.</p>

  <p>DHS plans to use the findings from the proof
  of concept to enhance its analytical tools, models, and risk methodologies to provide
  a greater understanding of how vulnerabilities and consequences associated with
  emerging threats such as cyber attacks can affect critical infrastructure assets, as
  well as the interdependency of physical and cyber vulnerabilities.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-3m" id="section-3m">Leveraging HITRAC Analytics to Aid Response and Recovery Efforts</a></h4>

  <p>Hurricane Sandy struck the U.S. Atlantic
  coastline in late October 2012, resulting in severe damage to more than 17 states.
  The storm was responsible for widespread power outages; massive damage to
  infrastructure, businesses, and private residences; and significant loss of life. The
  DHS HITRAC provided actionable analysis for decision makers before, during, and after
  Hurricane Sandy.</p>

  <p>
  <img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image032.png" alt="Title: Hurricane Sandy - Description: Image of a damaged pier in New Jersey." class="right"  />Before the storm made
  landfall in the U.S., HITRAC operated 24/7 to provide impact analysis, high-fidelity
  consequence modeling, and a listing of infrastructure protection priorities based on
  predictive analytic capabilities. HITRAC produced more than 20 analytic products and
  updates, which were disseminated to federal, state, and local partners. During the
  course of Hurricane Sandy, these products were updated based on the evolving
  situation to help the Protective Security Advisors, FEMA, and others involved in the
  response better prioritize restoration efforts.</p>

  <p>Following the storm, HITRAC provided DHS
  leadership with analysis of the impacts of closures of New Jersey fuel terminals and
  petroleum pipelines and New Jersey/New York port damage. It also supported
  prioritization of fuel distribution for backup power generation at specific critical
  infrastructure facilities, and deployed personnel to support the New York and New
  Jersey Joint Field Offices. During their time in the field, HITRAC representatives
  provided critical infrastructure analysis capabilities and supported
  FEMA's infrastructure recovery support function as part of the
  national disaster recovery framework.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-3n" id="section-3n">Addressing Economic and National Security Challenges</a></h3>

  <p>Private-sector
  organizations face a tremendous challenge in securing their classified information,

  Counterintelligence Executive, foreign adversaries are using advanced means to
  acquire this information to gain political, military, and economic advantage over the
  United States.<a href="#_ftn32" id="_ftnref32" title=""><sup>[32]</sup></a>
  And foreign intelligence services are leveraging the placement of
  individuals from all walks of life in a broad range of professions to achieve their
  objectives: as employees at U.S. firms, students and researchers at universities, and
  scientists at national laboratories. Foreign intelligence service collection efforts
  target nearly every entity involved in classified and unclassified high-end research
  throughout the United States.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-3o" id="section-3o">The FBI's National Security Business Alliance Council</a></h4>

  <p>The National

  <h4><a href="#section-3q" id="section-3q">Domestic Security Alliance Council</a></h4>

  <p>The Domestic Security Alliance Council
  (DSAC), a strategic partnership between the FBI, DHS, and the U.S. private sector,
  was established to promote the timely and effective exchange of information. The DSAC
  advances the FBI's mission to prevent, detect, and investigate
  criminal acts, particularly those affecting interstate commerce, while enhancing the
  ability of the private sector to protect its employees, assets, and proprietary
  information.</p>

  <p>The DSAC maintains a secure web
  portal&mdash;<a href="http://www.dsac.gov">www.dsac.gov</a>&mdash;for delivery of
  unclassified intelligence products, contact information, training material, and other
  information to DSAC members. The portal is a collaborative platform that allows
  members to work jointly to solve common problems. The portal also includes a
  discussion board so that members can share information trends and best
  practices.</p>

  <p>The DSAC continuing education opportunities
  include the Domestic Security Executive Academy (DSEA) and the Intelligence Analyst
  Symposium (IAS).</p>

  <p>The DSEA, a one-week program, is a strategic
  outreach program for corporate chief security officers, chief information security
  officers, and federal law enforcement senior executives, including FBI Field Office
  Special Agents in Charge. In 2012, more than 40 executives, the majority from the
  private sector, attended the DSEA.</p>

  <p>The IAS is a strategic training outreach
  program for sector-security analysts, FBI intelligence analysts, and other federal
  law enforcement partners. It is designed to teach analytical trade craft, share
  methodologies, discuss best practices, provide networking opportunities, and generate
  greater collaboration and cooperation. In 2012, more than 100 analysts, the majority
  from the private sector, attended IAS training sessions.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-3r" id="section-3r">FBI InfraGard</a></h4>

  <p>InfraGard is a two-way information sharing
  exchange between the FBI and more than 55,000 members of the public and private
  sector. With InfraGard, the FBI has successfully recruited technology and security
  professionals from the private sector to assist in the protection of the critical
  infrastructure of the U.S. through information sharing in a controlled-access
  environment. InfraGard provides members access to law enforcement sensitive (LES)
  analytical threat products pertaining to their areas of expertise. In turn, these
  members assist the FBI by initiating and/or enhancing FBI investigations and
  intelligence products.</p>

  <p>In 2012, InfraGard members initiated 163 FBI
  investigations, enhanced 435 ongoing FBI investigations, and disseminated
  intelligence used in 339 FBI reports to the IC. Through InfraGard activities, the FBI
  identified 100 U.S. banks that had been victimized by unauthorized ATM withdrawals in
  Romania, and as a result, 18 Romanian citizens were charged, 8 of whom were
  extradited to the U.S. for prosecution.</p>

  <p>InfraGard members will soon have access, via
  the InfraGard network, to iGuardian, a new portal that will provide tools to mitigate
  and prevent serious cyber-threats, scheduled for deployment in the summer of 2013.
  The FBI is adding iGuardian to its Guardian program and is developing it specifically
  for trusted industry partners within the critical infrastructure sectors.</p>

  <p>The InfraGard Network is scheduled to host a
  pilot test of the iGuardian portal with approximately 90 trusted industry partners.
  Upon successful completion of the pilot, a malware investigator tool will be piloted
  via iGuardian, adding the ability to submit suspected malware for analysis to the
  FBI. iGuardian is scheduled to officially become available via the InfraGard Network
  in July 2013. Future enhancements will include the ability to submit terrorist
  events, suspicious activity reports, and suspected counterintelligence espionage
  threats via the portal.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-3s" id="section-3s">All Hazards Consortium</a></h3>

  <p>The evolving threat to critical
  infrastructure has stimulated the creation and maturation of a variety of trusted
  partnerships, whether established under government auspices or through
  self-organizing initiatives of private-sector partners. Through these partnerships,
  critical infrastructure stakeholders leverage the collective expertise of their
  networks to improve risk management practices for identifying and mitigating threats,
  as well as response and recovery efforts.</p>

  <p>An example is the All Hazards Consortium
  (AHC), a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization founded in 2005 that includes
  representatives of all levels of government in the mid-Atlantic region, along with
  stakeholders from higher education, business and industry, non-profit and volunteer
  organizations, research firms, and trade associations. Focusing on homeland security,
  emergency management, and business continuity issues, the AHC's
  footprint represents more than 60 million citizens, a significant percentage of the
  nation's critical infrastructure, and more than 50% of all FEMA
  grant dollars issued to states, urban areas, and maritime ports in the United
  States.</p>

  <p>The AHC addresses issues related to managing
  natural and manmade hazards by regularly hosting regional meetings and conference
  calls that bring government and private-sector partners together to focus on specific
  issues. When participants identify a common need or priority, the AHC conducts a
  regional workshop in cooperation with the state sponsoring the issue. The needs,
  issues, best practices, lessons learned, and recommendations emerging from the
  workshop are memorialized in a "regional consensus"
  white paper that serves to create awareness and to attract funding and in-kind
  donations to help the states address the issues at hand.</p>

  <p>During emergencies the AHC activates its
  trusted relationships to assist in sharing critical recovery information between
  government and the private sector. For example, in the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy,
  the AHC realized the need to work with out-of-state entities to obtain assistance,
  and quickly turned to its private-sector partners to provide data, support, and
  services. The AHC organized this information into daily Private Sector Resource
  Reports, which showed potential "open and closed"
  locations for necessities such as fast food, fuel, hotels with available rooms, and
  pharmacies, and then emailed the information to tens of thousands of public and
  private stakeholders.</p>

  <p>AHC believes that three key best
  practices make the AHC's model successful.</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>
  It develops relationships with partners during normal operations so that in
  times of an event, participants comfortably and efficiently work together through
  established, trusted relationships.</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  Consortium members identify issues collaboratively, ensuring that there is
  broad buy-in to the AHC agenda.</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  The AHC's engagement with DHS and FEMA headquarters and
  the Regional Offices' technical assistance and resources maintains
  the Consortium's alignment with the National Infrastructure
  Protection Plan.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>Going forward, the AHC plans to
  improve upon and expand its existing model to include all FEMA regional offices and
  emergency response units, and to develop and implement a formal multi-state planning
  and information sharing process.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-4" id="section-4">Multimodal Information Sharing</a></h2>

  <p>Every year, millions of tons of cargo cross
  our nation's land borders or arrive at our airports and seaports,
  where it is then conveyed across complex maritime, air, rail, and roadway
  infrastructures. At the federal level, this vast and diverse combination of
  environments requires authorities to share a common operating picture to enable
  tracking of domestic chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear material
  conveyance across land, sea, and air, providing situational awareness for both
  federal and SLTT agencies.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-4a" id="section-4a">National Maritime Domain Awareness Architecture Plan Implementation</a></h3>

  <p>
  <img width="271" height="136" src="assets/img/image034.png" alt="Title: National MDA Architecture Plan - Description: Images of a phone booth in England, the U.S. Capitol, and a light post in Paris." class="right"  />The National Maritime
  Domain Awareness (MDA) Architecture Plan describes a National Maritime Information
  Sharing Environment (MISE) that is implemented through common data standards and
  architectural understanding; defines a framework that enables information sharing
  through use of a common vocabulary; and seeks to reduce cost by leveraging existing
  programs and systems. The architecture plan, implemented through the MISE, and the
  vocabulary, defined in the NIEM - Maritime, provides a proven,
  repeatable process for sharing maritime information.</p>

  <p>The first successful evaluation of the
  National MDA Architecture Plan was with international partners during the 2011/2012
  DoD Trident Warrior exercises. Standardized unclassified data sets were successfully
  shared between the United States, France, and the United Kingdom. Based on how
  Trident Warrior successfully facilitated the sharing of standards-based information
  between international partners, the National Maritime Intelligence-Integration Office
  (NMIO) partnered with the office of the PM-ISE to replicate the sharing of maritime
  data between domestic partners.</p>

  <p>In 2012, NMIO and the PM-ISE proposed the
  first operational implementation of the National MDA Architecture Plan, known as the
  Domestic Common Maritime Picture (DCMP). The DCMP is an unclassified, multi-agency
  information sharing effort in the port of Baltimore that improves maritime security
  and builds port partnerships. Through re-using the data exchanges successfully
  demonstrated in Trident Warrior, the DCMP has successfully integrated data from DoD,
  DHS, Department of Transportation (DOT), and the Maryland Natural Resources Police
  into the MISE.</p>

  <p>The National MDA Architecture Plan has
  proven successful. Organizations that choose to participate in the MISE are finding
  that sharing information through common missions of federal, state, and local
  government, as well as private-sector organizations can be a low-cost,
  clearly-defined process. Trust and understanding will continue to grow among
  participating organizations as implementation of the National MDA Architecture
  expands. As implementation efforts expand, safety and situational awareness within
  ports will increase, resulting in strengthened national security.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-4b" id="section-4b">DHS Coastal Surveillance System</a></h3>

  <p>The DHS Directorate of Science and
  Technology (S&amp;T) Directorate plans to leverage existing and new sensor

  (CSS). CSS is being built on a service-oriented architecture (SOA) framework and uses
  NIEM-Maritime standards to provide enhanced Maritime Situational Awareness by
  enabling affordable, persistent, and pervasive detection, classification,
  identification, tracking, and surveillance of afloat vessels. This system is being
  prototyped in partnership with the DHS Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Office of
  Air and Marine, at the Air and Marine Operations Center, and is being integrated with
  other CBP maritime domain awareness capabilities. The DHS S&amp;T effort started in

  and the mitigation of, high-level risks to the air domain.</p>

  <p>In January 2013, ADIIE completed development
  of a five-year strategic plan with the primary goals of developing the global air
  community; improving aviation information sharing; and advocating for aviation
  intelligence analysis. In addressing these goals, ADIIE has met with more than 250
  federal, state, local, tribal, private-sector, and international organizations; has
  created a directory of federal air intelligence organizations;<a

  <p>In addition, ADIIE is conducting two pilot
  projects to help SLTT law enforcement and private-sector partners eliminate barriers to air domain intelligence sharing and information exchange.
  Through these pilots, ADIIE will identify partner information sharing gaps and needs;
  work with partners to find solutions by leveraging existing resources when possible;
  and streamline processes for disseminating federal information and intelligence

collaborating, and sharing air-track and decision-support data among U.S. and Canadian
joint, intergovernmental, interagency, and multinational agencies in near real time.
Initially operational in December 2012, the Air Event Information Sharing Service (AEISS)
is a secure, web-enabled collaboration tool designed to improve situational awareness for
senior leaders and air defense and security mission partners across North
America.</p>

  <p>As of April 1, 2013, there were more than
  1,300 AEISS account holders in more than 40 operations centers across the United
  States and Canada, with new mission partners added each day. NORAD and USNORTHCOM are
  currently working with the DoD CIO and the Joint Staff on sustainment of the new
  capability. Additionally, the CBP Office of Air and Marine's Air
  and Marine Operations Center and USNORTHCOM have partnered to establish a technical
  infrastructure to create shared air-domain awareness with Mexico. This has resulted
  in tactical coordination of a Mexican response to more than 400 suspect air targets
  approaching the U.S. border thus far in FY 2013.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-5" id="section-5">Securing the U.S. Food Supply at Ports of Entry</a></h2>

  <p>The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
  works closely with CBP to protect the public from terrorist attacks on the U.S. food
  supply, and to prevent food that may be contaminated with biological, chemical, or
  radiological agents from entering the U.S. Personnel from each organization are
  collocated at CBP's National Targeting Center -
  Cargo, where CBP provides FDA analysts with direct access to several databases and
  information systems<a href="#_ftn34" id="_ftnref34" title=""><sup>[34]</sup></a>that are essential to carrying out the FDA's food defense
  responsibilities. This partnership facilitates information sharing between these
  organizations, and rapid response to potential vulnerabilities or threats to the U.S.
  food supply through the daily flow of information about imported shipments that raise
  concerns.</p>

  <p>Daily reports generated by CBP allow the FDA
  to cross reference potential persons of concern. FDA analysts perform regular
  searches of CBP's Automated Targeting System for potentially
  high-risk food shipments, which provide the FDA with early targeting of these
  shipments prior to receiving filed notices. For shipments of concern, and at the
  FDA's request, CBP places shipments on hold under the Bioterrorism
  Act, giving the FDA time for further examination and analysis.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-6" id="section-6">The DHS Joint Analysis Center Collaborative Information System (JACCIS)</a></h2>

  <p>JACCIS is the DHS Domestic Nuclear Detection
  Office's (DNDO) information technology system. It receives,
  manages, analyzes, and reports on data from the Global Nuclear Detection Architecture
  (GNDA). JACCIS facilitates the sharing of radiation and nuclear detection data among
  mission partners, and allows users to evaluate and categorize detection events. It
  incorporates information from multiple sources and allows analysts to collaborate,
  share, and correlate data. In June 2012, JACCIS implemented a NIEM standard message
  router, allowing real-time system interconnections with fixed and transportable
  radiation portal-monitoring equipment and mobile radiation detection equipment. In
  February 2013, it established connection with the Department of
  Energy's Triage system, providing local authorities with the
  ability to directly elevate alarms to the national level; thereby decreasing the time
  required to adjudicate alarms, and providing a central repository of alarm data to
  facilitate trending, fusion, and analysis.</p>

   networks to issue detailed situation reports with up-to-the-minute
   information about the locations of shelters, road closures, the status of
   public transportation vehicles, and the overall state of the disaster.
   Following the storm, the ROIC provided updated law enforcement-related
   information, maps, and other general public safety
   information&mdash;valuable data used in the protection and
   rehabilitation of communities severely impacted by the storm. Through the
   chiefs of police network, New Jersey ROIC personnel were deployed into the
   field and began the process of collecting information related to the
   condition of various municipal government buildings and other infrastructure.
   The reports were developed to share with FEMA and the U.S. Army Corps of
   Engineers to assist with prioritizing recovery efforts.<a

   <h5><a href="#section-7c" id="section-7c">Fusion Center Supports the Oak Creek Sikh Temple Active Shooter Incident</a></h5>

   <p><img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image044.png"  alt="Title: Wisconsin - Description: Image of Wisconsin flag on a globe." class="left"   />In August 2012, the Southeastern
   Wisconsin Threat Analysis Center (STAC) and its host agency, the Milwaukee
   Police Department (MPD), provided analytic support in response to the Oak
   Creek Sikh Temple active shooter incident. Members of the STAC and the Joint
   Intelligence Operations Center (JIOC) determined that the suspect was a known
   affiliate of a white supremacist group, and the shooting was handled as a
   domestic terrorism matter by the FBI's Milwaukee Division,
   which assumed the investigative lead. Both the FBI and MPD relied on
   STAC's intelligence and investigative support throughout
   the incident. The STAC led development of joint FBI fusion center products to
   further share information regarding the event, and leveraged the expertise
   from across the National Network to identify any additional leads or
   information pertaining to the suspect and the incident. Following the
   incident, the STAC infrastructure and training personnel provided
   recommendations for instituting a security framework for other infrastructure
   in the area and led efforts to raise awareness of threat indicators,
   including the importance of reporting suspicious activity to the proper law
   enforcement authorities.<a href="#_edn40" id="_ednref40" title=""><sup>[xl]</sup></a></p>

   <h5><a href="#section-7d" id="section-7d">Fusion Centers Support Money Laundering Investigation</a></h5>

   <p><img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image042.png"  alt="Title: Mount Rushmore - Description: Image of Mount Rushmore." class="right" />In July 2012, a
   South Dakota law enforcement officer discovered, during a traffic stop, that
   two foreign nationals were in possession of more than 100 stored value cards
   and a credit card reader. This raised suspicions because criminal
   organizations are known for stealing credit cards or credit card numbers and
   transferring money from them to stored value cards in order to circumvent
   customs reporting requirements. The officer reported this to the South Dakota
   Fusion Center (SDFC), which conducted state and federal records checks in
   coordination with the North Dakota State and Local Intelligence Center
   (NDSLIC) and Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). Records revealed that
   the individuals were identified in an active ICE transnational organized
   crime money laundering investigation involving stored value cards. The SDFC
   and NDSLIC were able to inform ICE of the officer's
   report, which was used to document the suspects'
   involvement in the ongoing criminal investigation.<a

   <h5><a href="#section-7e" id="section-7e">Fusion Centers Collaborate to Support Arrest of Individual Charged with Production of Child Pornography</a></h5>

   <p><img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image046.png"  alt="Title: Ft. Lauderdale - Description: Image of Ft. Lauderdale." class="left" />In June 2013, several phone
   calls across the Southeastern United States were made from a telephone
   belonging to an individual wanted for production of child pornography by an
   ICE office in Fort Lauderdale, Florida. ICE provided details of the wanted
   individual to the Central Florida Intelligence Exchange (CFIX) in Orlando and
   asked them to widely disseminate the information. Based on the location where
   the phone calls were being made, the CFIX notified the Tennessee Fusion
   Center and the Georgia Information Sharing and Analysis Center that the
   suspect might be in their area. These partners subsequently notified all
   relevant local law enforcement agencies in their area of responsibility. As a
   direct result of this interstate information sharing, the suspect was located
   and arrested by the Georgia State Patrol.</p>
