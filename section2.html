  <h1><a href="#section-0" id="section-0">Section 2: Information Discovery and Access through Common Standards</a></h1>

  <p>This section addresses the progress of ongoing efforts and new
  initiatives in the areas of information discovery and access. As defined in the 2012
  National Strategy for Information Sharing and Safeguarding (National Strategy),
  discovery and access are two distinct concepts, in which discovery is the
  user's ability to <em>identify</em> the existence
  of information, and access is the user's ability to
  <em>retrieve</em> it.</p>

  <p>The efforts of ISE mission partners and PM-ISE on fundamental
  elements of discovery and access are examined, to include data-level tagging; data
  aggregation; development and incorporation of interoperable, industry-accepted
  technical standards for information sharing solutions; and standards-based
  acquisition. Those activities that are identified as priorities in the National
  Strategy are noted in the following pages.</p>

  <p>The following list of findings highlights accomplishments and
  opportunities for improvement. Further detail is provided in the following pages.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-0a" id="section-0a">Accomplishments</a></h4>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>
  
  Department of Homeland Security (DHS) launched the Enhanced Overstay
  Vetting and Biographic Exit Project, which seeks to increase DHS's
  capability of identifying immigration violators and prioritizing them for
  enforcement;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS)
  Division expanded the capabilities of the Law Enforcement National Data Exchange
  (N-DEx) to accommodate more records and users, and to share investigative reports in
  near real time with criminal justice partners;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  Department of Defense (DoD) is adopting National Information Exchange Model (NIEM) as
  the best option for standards-based data exchanges;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  PM-ISE initiated and resourced an integrated project with DHS and the Open Geospatial
  Consortium (OGC) to use NIEM in enabling geospatial data to be discoverable,
  retrievable, and usable across the ISE by any standards-conformant map viewer;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  Object Management Group (OMG) officially approved the NIEM-Unified Modeling Language
  (NIEM-UML) profile as an OMG specification, opening the door for organizations to use
  NIEM-UML to simplify modeling in their architecture frameworks;</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  IJIS Institute "Springboard Team" conducted its first
  standards conformance test to determine whether a commercial data exchange met
  required interoperability standards; and</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   The
  PM-ISE is supporting a pilot project on an open-source implementation of the NIEM-UML
  Profile which will accelerate innovation and further streamline the development of
  NIEM-based functional standards.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h4><a href="#section-0b" id="section-0b">Opportunities</a></h4>
  <ul>
  	<li><p>
   In
  the previous reporting period, 65% of agencies reported little or no progress in
  working towards metadata tagging solutions. Since June 2012, ISE agency initiatives
  designed to address this include the use of DoD Architecture Framework (DoDAF)
  artifacts to enable cross-domain sharing by both the DoD Joint Information
  Environment and the Intelligence Community Information Technology Enterprise (IC
  ITE), and the work of DHS and DOT to develop data-tagging implementation plans for
  discovery and access control on their networks.</p></li>
  	<li><p>
   Last
  year's report found that centralized data correlation and data
  storage introduces privacy and security challenges that limit mission effectiveness;
  that finding is still valid. To address this, the National Strategy is prioritizing
  the development of a data aggregation reference architecture; the adoption of
  metadata standards to facilitate discovery, access, and monitoring across networks
  and security domains; and the definition and implementation of common standards to
  support automated discovery and access decisions. ISE activities that address these
  objectives are detailed in this section of the Report and in Section 3.</p></li>
  	<li><p>
  
  Agency responses to the 2013 ISE Performance Assessment Questionnaire (PAQ)
  show that about 50% of ISE agencies consider ISE functional and technical standards
  when issuing grants or RFPs for ISE-related systems. While implementation guidance
  actions were issued for updating grant and acquisition language to support the use of
  common standards, 43% of agencies have not provided best-practice recommendations to
  support this initiative. PM-ISE is working with General Services Administration (GSA)
  to leverage National Strategy implementation actions to accelerate the use of
  information sharing standards in acquisition language, and to foster reuse of these
  standards across the ISE mission partners. Health and Human Services (HHS), as
  co-chair of the Council on Financial Assistance Reform, will work with the Office of
  Management and Budget (OMB) to develop standard guidance for the grants and financial
  assistance community.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a href="#section-1" id="section-1">Standards Governance</a></h2>

  <h3><a href="#section-1a" id="section-1a">ISA IPC Standards Working Group, and the Standards Coordinating Council</a></h3>

  <p>As noted in previous reports, the ISA IPC Information
  Integration Sub-Committee (IISC) Standards Working Group (SWG) facilitates standards
  development and reuse by using a whole-of-government approach that fosters
  interoperable information exchanges between the Federal Government, state, local,
  tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government agencies, private-sector partners, and
  foreign partners and allies.<a href="#_edn42" id="_ednref42" title=""><sup>[xlii]</sup></a> By
  adopting common technical standards and forming consensus on common frameworks, ISE
  partners can make informed investment decisions by using shared resources,
  harmonizing policy, rationalizing business processes, integrating standards
  activities, and deploying technology to realize joint objectives and requirements.
  The Standards Coordinating Council (SCC)<a href="#_ftn36" id="_ftnref36" title=""><sup>[36]</sup></a> supports the ISA IPC
  Standards Working Group (SWG) in these efforts by representing the private
  sector's perspective in addressing the challenges of coordinating
  and influencing information sharing standards and initiatives.</p>

  <p>SCC partners, OMG, and the IJIS Institute hosted the
  second annual Workshop on Information Sharing &amp; Safeguarding Standards
  (WIS<sup>3</sup>) in March 2013. WIS<sup>3</sup> brought together government,
  standards development organizations, and industry partners to exchange ideas about
  the present and future of information sharing. The challenges and solutions addressed
  include:</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>Common Information Exchange Models,</strong> and the role that these models play in enabling information interoperability,
  including how adoption of standards like NIEM can help overcome the challenges of
  standards certification and common frameworks;</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>Frameworks and Shared Services,</strong> and how service-oriented architecture (SOA), reference architecture patterning,
  and cloud computing enable information sharing;</p>

      <p class="indent"><strong>Designing Privacy Protection into Policy</strong>
  to ensure that privacy policies accompany data during exchanges and
  aggregation, and to make privacy protections machine readable and standardized;
  and</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>Cybersecurity Information Sharing</strong> efforts to develop an information sharing framework for cybersecurity
  events.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-2" id="section-2">Standards Implementation</a></h2>

  <p>The National Strategy states that departments and agencies
  have an obligation to make information available to any agency, department, or
  partner with a relevant national security mission, and to manage that information in
  a manner that is lawful while ensuring the protection of privacy, civil rights, and
  civil liberties. To do this across the ISE, agencies must define and adopt common
  standards to support automated policy-based discovery and access decisions.<a href="#_ftn37" id="_ftnref37" title=""><sup>[37]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The ISA IPC SWG coordinates and oversees the
  government-wide adoption of these common standards for the ISE. Most importantly, the
  work done within ISE agencies and communities to identify, develop, and implement
  common standards ensures that mission-dependent information sharing capabilities are
  interoperable from the outset. Examples of agency standards governance bodies
  include:</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>The FBI's Advisory Policy Board
  (APB) and Technology Development and Deployment Board (TDDB)</strong> serve as authoritative bodies for standards development and ISE Technical
  Standards adoption, respectively;</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>The DoD CIO Executive Board</strong> oversees the DoD Standards Program, which develops and adopts standards for the
  Department;</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>The National Geospatial-Intelligence
  Agency's (NGA) Geospatial Intelligence Standards Working Group
  (GWG)</strong> is a National System for Geospatial-Intelligence (NSG)
  community forum for geospatial standards;</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>The Bureau of Justice Assistance's
  Global Standards Council</strong>; and</p>

  <p class="indent"><strong>The NIEM Executive Steering Council,</strong> on which DHS, Department of Justice (DOJ), and the HHS are
  represented.</p>

  <p>These agency standards-governance bodies, and others
  like them, inform and are informed by the government-wide standards implementation
  initiatives overseen by the ISA IPC. Currently, 93% of agencies that responded to the
  2013 ISE PAQ report incorporating ISE Technical Standards into their enterprise
  architectures and IT capabilities.<a href="#_edn43" id="_ednref43" title=""><sup>[xliii]</sup></a></p>

  <h3><a href="#section-2a" id="section-2a">National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)</a></h3>

  <p>NIEM provides a common vocabulary and supports enterprise-wide
  information exchange standards and processes that enable agencies throughout the
  nation to effectively share critical information in emergency situations, as well as
  to support day-to-day operations. Today, all 50 states and 20 federal agencies are
  committed to using NIEM in some capacity, and at some level of maturity. The value of
  NIEM is demonstrated every day across the country as it facilitates information
  exchanges to improve public safety, as well as health, human, and social services,
  and to strengthen homeland security.</p>

  <p>Work on the newest version of NIEM&mdash;NIEM
  3.0&mdash;began in August 2012. Driven by requirements to support
  information exchange between an ever expanding number of domains, including
  Biometrics; Chemical, Biological, Radioactive, and Nuclear (CBRN); Children, Youth,
  and Family Services (CYFS); Justice; Maritime; and Immigration and Screening,
  development activities are being reviewed by these communities with a planned release
  date scheduled for the fall of 2013.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-2b" id="section-2b">NIEM Unified Modeling Language (NIEM-UML)</a></h4>

  <p>The NIEM Unified Modeling Language (NIEM-UML) is a developing
  industry standard designed to help organizations implement information exchanges
  across systems, agencies, and levels of government by giving them a visual
  understanding of what it means to be NIEM-conformant. UML allows organizations to use
  a blueprint-like model to adopt and incorporate NIEM-based information
  exchanges&mdash;making NIEM implementation less technically
  demanding.<a href="#_edn44" id="_ednref44" title=""><sup>[xliv]</sup></a></p>

  <p>In September 2012, the OMG, whose members include hundreds of
  organizations, including virtually every large organization in the technology
  industry, officially approved the NIEM-UML profile as an OMG specification.<a href="#_edn45" id="_ednref45" title=""><sup>[xlv]</sup></a> This
  opens the door for organizations like the DoD to use NIEM-UML to simplify modeling in
  their architecture frameworks. Audiences with varying degrees of familiarity with
  NIEM technical concepts can also create variations of existing NIEM exchange packages
  that interoperate with other NIEM models.</p>

  <p>In addition, the PM-ISE is supporting a pilot project on the
  development of an open-source implementation of the NIEM-UML Profile, which will
  impact the development of NIEM-based functional standards, leading to
  interoperability between ISE agencies and mission partners.<a href="#_edn46" id="_ednref46" title=""><sup>[xlvi]</sup></a> The two
  principal deliverables will be an open- source codebase that will enable tool
  developers to implement the NIEM-UML profile, and a tool that will enable users to
  automatically produce NIEM-conformant specifications using UML. These tools offer
  users a pre-harmonized vocabulary that is supported by the community and will ensure
  that all users derive the same meaning from data elements, a critical factor in
  achieving interoperability.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-2c" id="section-2c">DoD Adopts the National Information Exchange Model (NIEM)</a></h4>

  <p>In March 2013, the DoD CIO announced that in compliance with
  White House guidance on the adoption of reference information exchanges, DoD will
  adopt NIEM for standards-based data exchanges, and will work with the NIEM Program
  Management Office to create a Military Operations (MilOps) Domain as part of
  NIEM.<a href="#_edn47" id="_ednref47" title=""><sup>[xlvii]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The Office of the DoD CIO will lead the development of a DoD
  Data Framework, which will provide guidance on governance, and technical direction
  for NIEM adoption. The DoD Data Framework will build upon the existing DoD data
  strategy, and will provide principles, rules, and additional guidance for managing
  data in a way that enables information sharing.</p>

  <p>
  <img width="109" height="109" src="assets/img/image048.png" alt="Title: Pentagon - Description: Image of the Pentagon and the National 9/11 Pentagon Memorial." class="right"  />The DoD transition to NIEM will incorporate
  the ongoing efforts of DoD Universal Core (UCore) and Command, and Control (C2) Core.
  The DoD CIO will no longer support the development of further enhancements to UCore
  and C2 Core as unique DoD data exchange models, but the applicable data components in
  UCore and C2 Core will form the initial content in the NIEM Core and the NIEM MilOps
  domains, respectively.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-2d" id="section-2d">NIEM Biometrics Domain</a></h4>

  <p>The NIEM Biometrics domain was formally established in July
  2012 to support biometric-related services and mission-based activities, such as
  homeland security, national defense, border management, immigration benefits, and
  global law enforcement, through the joint development and alignment of Biometric
  Standards. Built upon the early foundations of the DOJ Law Enforcement Information
  Sharing Program (LEISP), and operating under the stewardship of the DHS Office of
  Biometric Identity Management (OBIM), the Biometrics domain will support information
  sharing; establish data-exchange standards; and promote interoperability between
  federal agencies, SLTT government agencies, private-sector partners, and foreign
  partners and allies, utilizing biometric data and information. With the establishment
  of the Biometrics domain, members of the biometric community of interest will have
  the tools and a formally governed, common forum to ensure that biometric data is
  discoverable and retrievable by ISE mission partners.<a href="#_edn48" id="_ednref48" title=""><sup>[xlviii]</sup></a></p>

  <h4><a href="#section-2e" id="section-2e">DHS NIEM Cyber Incident-Sharing Prototype</a></h4>

  <p>DHS has sponsored a NIEM cyber-incident information sharing
  prototype to understand what data, tools, and techniques are necessary to enable
  cyber-incident information sharing across the Federal Government, SLTT government
  agencies, private-sector partners, and foreign partners and allies. The first phase
  of the prototype, conducted from May to August 2012, exchanged cyber-incident data
  based on a NIEM message header, the MITRE Corporation's Structured
  Threat Information eXpression (STIX)&trade; schema, and used a central
  repository hosted at Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Lab. This phase of the
  prototype demonstrated how a centralized, trusted broker can facilitate a
  cyber-incident information exchange between multiple sites.</p>

  <p>The second phase, conducted from September 2012 to March 2013,
  focused on controlling data access by using Personal Identity Verification (PIV)
  attributes and a Backend Attribute Exchange (BAE) across the enterprise for
  authentication.<a href="#_edn49" id="_ednref49" title=""><sup>[xlix]</sup></a> Data
  owners used a NIEM-based common data-tagging tool to tag data fields and to document
  the classification of the cyber incident. Data consumers, using a browser
  application, could search for and, based on their PIV credentials, access shared
  cyber incidents. The second phase demonstrated how data owners can control access to
  cyber incident information that is in distributed databases across the ISE.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-2f" id="section-2f">Using NIEM to Share Information between the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs</a></h3>

  <p>In the fall of 2012, the PM-ISE and the DoD initiated a pilot
  project using NIEM-UML-based tools to develop a NIEM Information Exchange Package
  Documentation (IEPD) for the DoD and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to share
  electronic records of candidates undergoing the recruitment process for military
  service. The pilot involves secure collaboration between the U.S. Military Entrance
  Processing Command, the Office of the Deputy Chief Management Officer, and the Office
  of the Under Secretary of Defense for Personnel and Readiness. The pilot is nearing
  completion, and the lessons learned will be used as the foundation for future
  NIEM-based data exchange between DoD and the VA.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-2g" id="section-2g">Standardizing Country Codes across Federal Databases</a></h3>

  <p>
  <img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image050.png" alt="Title: NGA - Description: Image of the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency's headquarters." class="right"  />NGA, in its role as the geospatial
  intelligence functional manager,<a href="#_ftn38" id="_ftnref38" title=""><sup>[38]</sup></a> is
  leading the <a href="http://www.gwg.nga.mil/ccwg.php">Country Codes
  Working Group</a>, a Federal Government forum that is coordinating the
  transition from the use of the two-character country codes defined in the Federal
  Information Processing Standard <a href="http://www.itl.nist.gov/fipspubs/fip10-4.htm">(FIPS)
  10-4</a> to the three-character Geopolitical Entities, <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/country_codes.htm">International Standards Organization (ISO) 3166</a>. The transition to
  the new standard will impact all federal systems and standards that contain or
  include country identifiers. Most, if not all, ISE systems will be impacted by the
  transition. This new standard is crucial for enabling simplified discovery and
  retrieval of geographically-coded information by analysts and investigators across
  multiple databases.<a href="#_edn50" id="_ednref50" title=""><sup>[l]</sup></a></p>

  <h3><a href="#section-2h" id="section-2h">Open Geospatial Standards</a></h3>

  <p>In order to be usable across all ISE communities, geospatial
  data must be standards-based, interoperable, and usable by any geospatial map viewer.
  The DHS Geospatial Concept of Operations identifies OGC and the use of NIEM as best
  practices for geospatial information sharing, and the National Level Exercise (NLE)
  2012<a href="#_ftn39" id="_ftnref39" title=""><sup>[39]</sup></a>
  validated the importance of standards-based interoperability for geospatial
  data&mdash;the general conclusion being that
  "mapable" data should be discoverable, retrievable,
  and usable by any authorized user, using any standards-conformant map viewer.</p>

  <p>In an effort to make data
  "mapable," the PM-ISE initiated and resourced an
  integrated project with the DHS NIEM Program Management Office (NIEM PMO), the DHS
  Office of Science and Technology, and the OGC, to enhance the NIEM architecture for
  the geospatial domain by developing, testing, and documenting embedded Geospatial
  Markup Language (GML) architecture reference guidance.</p>

  <p>The OGC Interoperability Program initiative<a
  href="#_ftn40" id="_ftnref40" title=""><sup>[40]</sup></a>
  objectives, referred to as Geo4NIEM, include developing NIEM-compliant geospatial
  standards and naming conventions; testing and demonstrating these standards and
  conventions with ISE community partners; and developing recommendations for the
  inclusion of a Geospatial Domain within NIEM. This initiative is designed to foster
  broader community adoption of NIEM across the geospatial community.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-3" id="section-3">Standards-based Acquisition for Information Sharing</a></h2>

  <p>The success of the ISE requires the consistent use of
  interoperable standards in the products and services that ISE organizations acquire.
  Effective information sharing requires employing the decentralized, distributed, and
  coordinated approach outlined in IRTPA. New technology is driving changes in
  infrastructure operations, including cloud, mobile, and SOA solutions.</p>

  <p>Agencies are focusing on controlling costs, avoiding
  duplication, and sharing services. However, there is still little consistency when
  referencing or enforcing the use of information sharing frameworks, standards, and
  guidance in RFPs, grants, or other acquisition vehicles.</p>

  <p>
  <img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image052.png" alt="Title: Signpost - Description: Image of a signpost with directional arrows to multiple states." class="left"  />As a result, the PM-ISE is working with the
  ISA IPC's SWG and SCC to reevaluate the baseline set of technical
  standards needed for information exchange. This effort will help create a common set
  of technical standards that should be incorporated into all ISE
  partners' enterprise architectures.<a href="#_edn51" id="_ednref51" title=""><sup>[li]</sup></a></p>

  <p>There is general movement across the ISE to employ standards
  requirements for contracts, indicating movement toward an information sharing
  culture. More than 60 standards development organizations were identified, 9 of which
  are responsible for more than 20 standards each.</p>

  <p>There is a wide variation in the depth and breadth of
  standards identified. Agencies need to refresh their standards profiles/roadmaps, as
  many obsolete standards are still mandated.</p>

  <p>Other barriers to standards implementation include the Federal
  Government's annual budget-planning cycle, the time it takes to
  ratify a standard (often upwards of two years), the rapidity of technology change,
  and the ability for a standard to be defined quickly enough.</p>

  <p>Findings from the analysis will be incorporated into the ISE
  Common Information Sharing Standards Manual updates.</p>

  <p>In addition, last year's report
  included the PM-ISE and GSA sponsored initiative, through the American Council for
  Technology - Industry Advisory Council (ACT-IAC), to provide an
  industry perspective on standards-based acquisition. That initiative resulted in an
  ACT-IAC White Paper, "Responsible Information Sharing: Engaging
  Industry to Improve Standards-Based Acquisition &amp; Interoperability,"
  which identified the following findings on the use of ISE Interoperability
  standards:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p> Focus on streamlining governance for interoperability
  standards. A repeatable standards-governance process is necessary to define
  interoperability requirements and coordinate standards development activities across
  mission areas and governmental jurisdictions.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Develop a standards roadmap. In order to encourage
  adoption of interoperability standards, the government needs to clearly describe its
  target vision for how interoperability will be achieved and the standards that will
  enable it.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Leverage standards conformance testing and pilots to
  minimize risk. Reusing standards that have been developed collectively, tested for
  standards conformance, or piloted within a certain mission area or IT platform will
  minimize risk.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Incorporate standards requirements into all strategic
  management processes. Beginning with strategic planning,
  government's interoperability standards requirements need to be
  clearly defined and the potential return on investment from using standards needs to
  be captured.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Enhance training and outreach. Enhancing training and
  improving outreach with industry and other stakeholder groups will garner greater
  dividends and help ensure results.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>This joint effort with GSA was further refined with the
  release of the National Strategy, which details the need to
  "leverage collective demand through acquisition," as
  one of 16 priority objectives. Working with GSA, PM-ISE intends to use the analysis
  of agency-specific use of technical standards, the ACT-IAC White Paper, and the
  results from pilot programs to accelerate the use of information sharing standards in
  acquisition and grant language, and to foster reuse of standards. The recommendations
  from these efforts will be captured in a final report to be presented to policy
  makers.</p>

  <p>PM-ISE is also participating in the Integrated Justice
  Information Systems (IJIS) Institute's Task Force on Procurement
  Innovation&mdash;an effort between government, industry, and academia
  that will look at the challenges facing state and local police procurements. The
  purpose of the Task Force is to define the scope and priority of procurement issues
  relevant to improving the entire procurement process. It will take a national
  perspective, to include federal, state, local, tribal, and territorial programs, in
  order to define the context of "national"
  guidelines.</p>

  <p>This Task Force will:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p> Prepare a comprehensive catalogue of prevailing
  practices in each of the sectors so that members of the task force may intelligently
  review what is good and what is bad about existing approaches to procurement.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Identify areas within current practices that members of
  the Task Force believe are contributing to less-than-optimal performance results.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Specifically examine the role that nationally accepted
  technology standards may play in improving procurement practices.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Specify additional steps needed to develop acceptance
  for procurement.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Recommend a framework within which further development
  of a "best practices" guide can be developed and
  promoted to the entities involved in both the public and private sector.</p></li>
  </ul>

  <p>The result of this Task Force may be the creation of an
  IJIS Institute Advisory Committee on Procurement Initiatives. In this event, the Task
  Force will work with the IJIS Institute to develop the charter, and recommendations
  on how the committee should be structured.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-4" id="section-4">Data Aggregation</a></h2>

  <p>The vision for Data Aggregation is to promote a
  whole-of-government data stewardship approach among mission owners (data producers)
  to allow the collective national security enterprise to discover cross-agency
  connections in real-time and to drive mission results, while ensuring that proper
  safeguards are enforced. The mission to disrupt terrorist acts before they occur is
  enabled by finding, sharing, and collaborating on interpreting data that comes from
  trusted and reliable mission partners. The goals of data aggregation are achieved
  through an established governance process that enables mission partners to obtain the
  data necessary to perform their missions through shared ISE enterprise services,
  while protecting the privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties of persons for whom
  no nexus to terrorism exists.</p>

  <p>Key to enabling access and dissemination of aggregated data
  within the ISE is the capability to authenticate users across the environment.
  Through positive user authentication and authorization, logging of user access to
  data, and the ability to audit data trails, the risks to privacy, civil rights, and
  civil liberties associated with the sharing of aggregated data are mitigated. The
  National Strategy identifies data aggregation, or enterprise-wide data correlation,
  as a goal, and several ISE agencies are implementing solutions.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-4a" id="section-4a">Data Exchange Tool Kit</a></h3>

  <p>DHS, the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC), and two
  other members of the intelligence community (IC) began a data-exchange pilot program,
  sponsored by PM-ISE and supported by the ISA IPC Data Aggregation Working Group
  (DAWG), to improve interagency, person-centric information exchanges, and to
  highlight best practices and lessons learned. Year One of the pilot was completed in
  September 2012. The participants were successful in improving the consistency,
  timeliness, and quality of the exchanges of data produced by DHS and consumed by two
  members of the IC.<a href="#_edn52" id="_ednref52" title=""><sup>[lii]</sup></a></p>

  <p>The team established a performance baseline for each exchange
  and created a NIEM-Extensible Markup Language (XML) sample data set for testing each
  exchange. The processes and templates developed in the pilot, along with lessons
  learned, were documented in the Data Exchange Toolkit, which provides comprehensive templates, guidelines, and
  documentation for data exchange, and highlights best practices and lessons learned.
  The Toolkit is available online at <a href="http://www.ise.gov/building-blocks">http://www.ise.gov/building-blocks</a>.</p>

  <p>In October 2012, the DAWG and DHS kicked off Year Two of the
  pilot, which is aimed at validating, refining, and re-using repeatable processes and
  tools to improve High-Valued Data Set (HVDS) exchanges across the ISE. The
  second-year goals, scheduled to be completed in September 2013, are to improve [two
  interagency, person-centric information exchanges], using NIEM for exchange services;
  to perform an information-exchange assessment using the Data Exchange Toolkit
  developed during Year One, in order to identify exchange improvement areas involving
  high value data; and to provide enhancement capabilities for processes developed in
  the previous pilot year to extend the impact and address a two-way information
  exchange.<a href="#_edn53" id="_ednref53" title=""><sup>[liii]</sup></a> The use
  of NIEM, along with a strong performance management approach, will allow DHS and the
  DAWG to demonstrate improvements in information sharing using clear performance
  metrics.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-4b" id="section-4b">Data Aggregation Capability Updates and Success Stories</a></h3>

  <h4><img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image054.png" alt="Title: N-DEx - Description: Law Enforcement National Data Exchange logo." class="right"  /><a href="#section-4c" id="section-4c">Law Enforcement National Data Exchange (N-DEx)</a></h4>

  <p>The FBI Criminal Justice Information Services (CJIS)
  Division's National Data Exchange (N-DEx) is the first and only
  national investigative information sharing system. N-DEx provides federal, state,
  local, and tribal criminal justice agencies with a secure mechanism for searching,
  linking, analyzing, sharing, and collaborating with partners in interpreting more
  than 180 million records spanning the criminal justice lifecycle. Over the past six
  months, N-DEx has enjoyed growth in both sharing and usage, experiencing a 20%
  increase in searchable ingested records; a 4% increase in contributing agencies; a
  57% increase in total available system users; and an 8% increase in average weekly
  searches. During 2012, the number of registered N-DEx users more than tripled.</p>

  <p>N-DEx development is strategically aligned with the evolving
  needs of the criminal justice community, and in 2012 expanded system capabilities to
  accommodate records and users from probation, pre-trial services, parole,
  corrections, district attorneys, courts and magistrate offices, custodial facilities,
  regional dispatch centers, and prosecutors' offices. Several state
  Departments of Corrections are now sharing data with N-DEx, including Indiana,
  Kansas, Nebraska, and Mississippi. Also in 2012, the FBI began sharing its
  investigative reports in near real-time with its criminal justice partners via
  N-DEx.<a href="#_edn54" id="_ednref54" title=""><sup>[liv]</sup></a></p>

  <h4><a href="#section-4d" id="section-4d">Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS)</a></h4>

  <p>The FBI continued to implement a single, secure, web­‐based search and analysis capability called
the Data Integration and Visualization System (DIVS), which imports electronic data from Sensitive
But Unclassified/Controlled Unclassified Information
(SBU/CUI) networks belonging to other government
agencies. DIVS also provides an interface with
internally produced data from FBI SBU/CUI networks.
DIVS allows FBI agents and intelligence analysts to
“connect the dots” to determine the identities and
intentions of terrorists and other threats to the
nation through the use of FBI and other agency data.<a href="#_edn55" id="_ednref55" title=""><sup>[lv]</sup></a></p>

  <table border="0" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" class="table table-bordered table-striped">
      <tr>
          <td>In National City, CA detectives were investigating a
              missing person case that had been open for two years. After receiving access to
              N-DEx, a National City Police Department investigator searched the missing
              person's name in the system. N-DEx returned
              results indicating the person had been
              arrested and was incarcerated in a
              neighboring county. After confirming the
              information with the correctional institution,
              the name was removed from the police
              department’s database as a missing person.
              N-DEx was instrumental in locating the
              missing person, closing the case, and freeing
              up resources for active cases.</td>
      </tr>
  </table>

  <p>The FBI met major milestones for its agents and analysts
  supporting ISE-related missions to use shared data from other government agencies by
  completing the migration of DIVS to the FBI Consolidated Data Centers; ingesting all
  critical Investigative Data Warehouse (IDW) data sets into DIVS, retaining validated
  IDW user functionalities; exceeding the target number of data sets into DIVS,
  bringing up the total number from 51 to 74; increasing the DIVS record capacity from
  three to four billion records through the addition of new server hardware and
  software purchases; and increasing usage to 1,901 users per day.</p>

  <p>Among the upgrades are a single interface to common data
  collections, and the merger of single-search Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act
  data. Another key feature for IDW users is the switch to the DIVS single sign-on
  process. DIVS access is seamless through an employee's desktop
  login&mdash;there is no separate log-in screen. As a result of the
  DIVS-IDW merger, analysts have easier access and greater visibility into geospatial
  and analytic tools.</p>

  <p>Other tools that allow searching of imported data and reports
  have been reused and placed under the DIVS user interface. These include Specialized
  Search Tools for Financial Crimes Enforcement Network Suspicious Activity Reports
  (SAR); Consular Consolidated Database (CCD); Student Exchange and Visitor Information
  System (SEVIS); I-94 Arrival/Departure Records; and Suspicious Activity Report Batch
  Analysis Review (SARBAR).</p>

  <p>Going forward, all data access will be tied to an
  attribute-based access control (ABAC) solution, which DIVS will be prepared to
  enforce. Perhaps the most critical, far-reaching outcome from the merger is the
  organizational focus DIVS brings to enterprise data management, enabling the FBI to
  build a better data-sharing environment for internal and external government
  stakeholders.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-4e" id="section-4e">iDATA: Bringing FBI Systems Together</a></h4>

  <p>The FBI Intelligence Data Association and Tagging Application
  (iDATA) is a data management and tagging tool designed to standardize, manage,
  relate, and deliver key FBI data sets by providing an authoritative central
  repository that utilizes common standard data elements such as Crime Problem
  Indicator (CPI), Case Classification, and Country codes, as well as FBI and U.S. IC
  collection requirements used within the intelligence lifecycle.</p>

  <p>iDATA provides data managers with an intuitive web
  application, web services, and user interface that allows them to manage content flow
  between intelligence systems. The web services also provide enterprise-wide user
  search results of tagged collected intelligence with uniform data values. iDATA
  Release 1.3.1 has been deployed to the enterprise with a current pilot group review
  of web service search capabilities. Interface testing is expected to be completed by
  the end of the 4th quarter of FY 2013.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-4f" id="section-4f">DHS-Enhanced Overstay Vetting and Biographic Exit Project</a></h4>

  <p>In April 2013, information systems owned by several DHS
  components went live with modernization efforts that were developed under the
  Enhanced Overstay Vetting and Biographic Exit Project. This project seeks to increase
  DHS's capability to identify immigration violators and prioritize
  them for enforcement, with a focus on those who represent the greatest national
  security or public safety risk. The connections from the National Protection and
  Programs Directorate (NPPD), the Office of Biometric Identity
  Management's (OBIM) Arrival Departure Information System (ADIS);
  the Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Targeting and Analysis Systems Program
  Office's (TASPO) Automated Targeting System (ATS), and
  ICE's Counterterrorism and Criminal Exploitation
  Unit's (CTCEU) LeadTrac were upgraded from batch files processed
  via email to secure and fully automated interfaces.</p>

  <p>The upgraded interfaces increased the accuracy and efficiency
  of lead generation and automated lead vetting. Part of this was achieved by updating
  the interface between ADIS and the Student &amp; Exchange Visitor Information System
  (SEVIS), which is owned by ICE's Student &amp; Exchange Visitor
  Program (SEVP). This update allowed a drastic increase in the efficiency of
  generating overstay <img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image056.png" alt="Title: Airplane - Description: Image of an airplane." class="left"  />leads based on SEVIS data, in addition to increasing the
amount and relevancy of data displayed in ADIS's user interface.
Concurrently, TASPO developed a new user interface for CTCEU analysts to use when
manually vetting overstay leads. This interface aggregates data from several source
systems in one location, saving analysts' time by reducing the number
of manual queries they have to initiate.<a href="#_edn56" id="_ednref56" title=""><sup>[lvi]</sup></a> CBP,
  ICE, and OBIM are currently developing the next phase of upgrades to this system to
  further increase the data quality, efficiency, and the quality of analytical tools
  for the national security overstay mission.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-4g" id="section-4g">DHS Commercial Targeting Analysis Center (CTAC) Data Mash-up</a></h4>

  <p>CTAC is a multiagency fusion center that leverages the
  expertise of CBP and partner agency personnel for the purpose of targeting commercial
  shipments of high-risk commodities that pose a threat to the health and safety of the
  American public. The Center employs a six-step risk mitigation strategy during which
  it identifies risk; establishes a scope of targeting; systematically targets the
  risk; initiates cargo examination (in coordination with field resources); reports
  findings; and evaluates the results/effectiveness of the targeting.</p>

  <p>The CTAC Data Mash-Up is a database that was created to assist
  DHS's CBP targeting efforts on behalf of partner agencies by
  better measuring targeting effectiveness. This required effective downstream
  results-reporting from multiple Federal Government systems. Mash-Up extracts
  information from various CBP and Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC) systems,
  in order to present targeting results in a cohesive stream of actions and events.
  This allows for effective analysis and tracking of results, which translates into
  better targeting decisions and reduced impact on trade flows into the United States.
  The information sharing capacity authorized under the CTAC Memorandum of
  Understanding (MOU) provides for the sharing of information between partner
  government agencies in order to make this program a success.</p>

  <p>Evidence of CTAC's success can be seen in
  its efforts to prevent illegal imports of vehicles that violate National Highway
  Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) safety standards and EPA regulations. CBP has
  coordinated with the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and
  NHTSA&mdash;two agencies with regulatory authority over
  vehicles&mdash;to ensure that unsafe vehicles from overseas markets do
  not reach U.S. roadways. These three agencies have combined resources at CTAC to
  share data, analyze import trends, and conduct joint risked-based targeting,
  resulting in the seizure of dozens of illegal vehicles since October 2012.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-4h" id="section-4h">Data Aggregation Challenges and Next Steps</a></h3>

  <p>The current state of data aggregation will soon undergo
  transformation as a result of three major trends: ongoing budgetary constraints;
  increased data complexity; and safeguarding requirements. The National Strategy is
  influencing this transformation by providing a framework for implementing a data
  aggregation reference architecture; identifying gaps and dependencies; and aligning
  with other ISE services such as discovery, access, and data tagging.</p>

  <p>The data aggregation community is feeling the impact of
  budgetary constraints. The development of new projects is competing with mission
  priorities, leading to fewer technical resources available for transformation
  projects. As directed by the National Strategy, the DAWG will work to address these
  challenges over the next several years. The DAWG has begun building the framework for
  an architecture that enables communities of data owners to share information that has
  already been correlated for a specific mission need, and the services needed to
  interoperate with a larger community of data consumers, and has released a vision
  paper that describes the framework, services, and data required for
  interoperability.</p>

  <p>In the summer of 2013, the DAWG will sponsor a government Data
  Aggregation Summit of system and data architects. The goal is to codify the vision
  for data aggregation and the value of a strategy that emphasizes sharing correlated
  data between departments and agencies rather than raw data. Following the summit, the
  DAWG will engage industry in soliciting input on architectural solutions that might
  help industry better understand government requirements.</p>

  <p>Building on the success of the data aggregation pilot in 2012,
  a second pilot will be completed in September 2013 between the Department of State,
  DHS, and NCTC, to automate some manual processes in the Electronic System for Travel
  Authorization (ESTA) vetting process, using common standards and exchange methods.
  This pilot will influence the final reference architecture framework and will
  implement real-life improvements in the current process.</p>

  <td width="439">
   <p>Sponsored by PM-ISE and the
   DOJ's Bureau of Justice Assistance (BJA), and managed by
   the Integrated Justice Information Systems (IJIS) Institute, IJIS Springboard
   is a standards-based interoperability program designed to advance justice,
   public safety, and homeland security information sharing. The program
   provides an environment in which industry and government can cooperatively
   evaluate standards and certify that industry products are standards-compliant
   through a conformance management process.<a href="#_edn57"  id="_ednref57" title=""><sup>[lvii]</sup></a></p>

   <p>Based on lessons learned from the
   Open Geospatial Consortium's (OGC) Interoperability
   Program, Springboard strives to create a governance structure and process
   whereby industry can use government-approved standards in a consensus-based
   "open" standards implementation process, and
   can leverage existing technologies to accelerate information
   sharing.</p>

   <h5><a href="#section-5a" id="section-5a">Springboard Certifies First Product</a></h5>

   <p><img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image058.png"  alt="Title: Prescriptions - Description: Image of medical prescription bottles." class="right"   />In December 2012,
   the IJIS Institute Springboard team conducted its first standards conformance
   test to determine whether a new <a href="https://www.bja.gov/ProgramDetails.aspx?Program_ID=72">Prescription Drug Monitoring Program</a> (PDMP) <a href="http://ijis.org/_programs/pdmp.html">Information Exchange
   (PMIX)</a> met the required interoperability
   standards, using a web-based program that collects, analyzes, and reports
   information on the prescription, dispensation, and use of prescription drugs.
   Many states currently report problems with "pill
   mills"&mdash;doctors who prescribe large quantities
   of painkillers to people who do not need them
   medically&mdash;and the sharing of information about
   prescription drugs is one way to reduce prescription drug abuse.</p>

   <p>Going forward, the IJIS Institute is
   prepared to test other standards through the Springboard program, in order to
   ensure conformance to the national standards for companies that create
   information sharing products for use in the areas of public safety and
   criminal justice. These standards not only improve information sharing across
   states, but they can save organizations and taxpayers money by ensuring that
   organizations (pharmacies, police departments, prisons) that use information
   products that conform to standards do not create a new solution every time
   they want to share data.</p>
