  <p>This section addresses ISE initiatives that are focused on
  ensuring the protection of privacy, civil rights, and civil liberties (P/CR/CL)
  through the consistent government-wide application of protections.</p>

  <p>The following list of findings highlights accomplishments and
  opportunities for improvement. Further detail is provided in the pages that
  follow.</p>

  <h4><a href="#section-0b" id="section-0b">Opportunities</a></h4>

  <ul>
  	<li>
  		<p>
  		
  		While there have been initiatives to measure and ensure privacy compliance,
  		there currently is not an effective ISE-wide performance measurement for internal
  		agency compliance, oversight, and accountability mechanisms to ensure consistent
  		application of P/CR/CL protections. The development of these measures is a priority
  		for the ISA IPC P/CL Subcommittee.</p>
  	</li>
  </ul>

  <h2><a href="#section-1" id="section-1">Strategic Objectives and Priorities Established for the
  	ISE</a></h2>

  <p>Several priority objectives identified in the National
  Strategy have P/CR/CL implications, and their implementation will provide for a more
  uniform application of P/CR/CL protections across the ISE by helping mission partners
  reach a common understanding of such safeguards.</p>

  <p>Over the last year, the Privacy and Civil Liberties (P/CL)
  Subcommittee and its Privacy and IT Working Group (PITWG) have been developing
  guidelines for information sharing and safeguarding agreements that will both ensure
  that mission needs are met, and ensure the protection of personally identifiable
  information and P/CR/CL. A common process for framing these agreements adds value by
  promoting a mutual understanding of appropriate protections among information sharing
  partners, and by sharpening the partners' focus on legal and
  policy requirements, data uses, and identification of mission purposes for the
  acquisition of information. This is particularly important when partners have vastly
  different authorities and mission requirements.</p>

  <p>With input from the Data Aggregation Working Group, PITWG has
  taken these principles into consideration in its on draft policy guidance to address
  key P/CR/CL requirements for information sharing and safeguarding agreements and
  identifying ways to streamline the development process. The policy guidance is
  projected to be disseminated to ISE stakeholders in 2013 and subsequently
  supplemented by a checklist, which may include sample language.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-2" id="section-2">P/CR/CL Governance</a></h2>

  <p>The ISA IPC works with the office of the PM-ISE and serves as
  a key governance body for carrying out the strategic vision and priority objectives
  set forth in the National Strategy. It brings federal partners together to develop
  strategic, cross-cutting approaches to addressing information sharing and
  safeguarding requirements. The ISA IPC P/CL Subcommittee is comprised of senior
  privacy and civil liberties representatives from ISE federal mission partners as
  identified in EO 13358, or as designated by the Director of National Intelligence.
  The Subcommittee is steered by an Executive Committee of senior P/CL officers from
  the ODNI, DHS, and DOJ, and is chaired by the ODNI Civil Liberties Protection
  Officer.</p>

  <p>Since its re-constitution in September 2010, the P/CL
  Subcommittee has advised the ISA IPC on the best means for strengthening the
  protection of P/CR/CL within information sharing and safeguarding activities by
  federal agencies, SLTT government agencies, and private-sector partners. Over the
  past year, P/CL Subcommittee members have focused on supporting initiatives and
  developing tools to help mission partners consistently apply P/CR/CL requirements,
  including technical assistance to support the development of ISE privacy policies,
  the development of draft guidance to streamline the process for developing
  information sharing agreements, and the development and piloting of a compliance
  review self-assessment template.</p>

   <p>Established by the Implementing Recommendations of
   the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight
   Board (PCLOB) became operational as an independent oversight agency within
   the executive branch during the 2012-2013 reporting period. The Board has a
   full-time chairman and four part-time board members. All are nominated by the
   President and confirmed by the Senate.</p>

   <p>The PCLOB has both a consultative and an oversight
   role regarding P/CR/CL in the Federal Government's
   development and use of the ISE. The PCLOB has two primary purposes: 1) to
   analyze and review actions the executive branch takes to protect the U.S.
   from terrorism, ensuring that the need for such actions is balanced with the
   need to protect privacy and civil liberties; and 2) to ensure that liberty
   concerns are appropriately considered in the development and implementation
   of laws, regulations, and policies related to efforts to protect the Nation
   against terrorism.</p>

  <h3><a href="#section-2a" id="section-2a">Development and Implementation of ISE Privacy
  	Policies</a></h3>

  <p>A significant area of focus and P/CL Subcommittee attention
  has been in the development and adoption of written P/CR/CL policies, as required by
  the <em>ISE Privacy Guidelines</em>. In last
  year's Annual Report, PM-ISE reported that federal partners
  continued to make slow but steady progress toward the completion of these P/CR/CL
  policies, with 79% of federal ISE departments and agencies having completed-policies
  in place.<a href="#_ftn53" id="_ftnref53" title=""><sup>[53]</sup></a> As of
  July 2013, the completion rate is 93%, due to DOC, HHS, Treasury, and DOE having
  finalized their policies. DoD is currently revising its directive, DoDD 5400.11, to
  commit to following the <em>ISE Privacy Guidelines</em> in
  lieu of issuing a stand-alone ISE privacy policy.</p>

  <p>
  	<small>Figure 4. Federal ISE Privacy Policy Status.</small>
  </p>
  <p>State, local, tribal and territorial partners continue to demonstrate their commitment to
protecting P/CR/CL by prioritizing the development and implementation of privacy policies that
are at least as comprehensive as the ISE Privacy Guidelines. In addition, all 78 fusion centers have an approved privacy policy that is at least as comprehensive as the ISE Privacy Guidelines.</p>
<h2><a href="#section-3" id="section-3">Compliance Activities</a></h2>
<p>During the past year, ISE agencies reported using one or more of the following mechanisms for
ensuring compliance with statutory and regulatory authorities, <em>ISE Privacy Guidelines</em>
requirements, agency legal guidance, protocols, and policies:</p>
<ul>
	<li><p> Reviewing information sharing and safeguarding
  agreements and other mechanisms to ensure that the activities comply with legal and
  agency policy requirements;</p></li>
	<li><p> Conducting programmatic reviews of law enforcement
  programs;</p></li>
	<li><p> Auditing intelligence systems;</p></li>
	<li><p> Reviewing intelligence reporting that is to be shared
  within the ISE, before that information is disseminated to ISE partners; and</p></li>
	<li><p> Periodic Office of Inspector General reviews of privacy
  and security practices.</p></li>
</ul>

  <p>In addition, DHS established a formal process to
  conduct compliance reviews for the implementation of privacy protections within and
  across the Department's information sharing programs. Over the
  last year, the DHS Privacy Office conducted and completed a review of
  DHS's participation in the Nationwide Suspicious Activity
  Reporting Initiative (NSI) and is currently updating its internal processes to comply
  with recommendations resulting from this review.</p>

  <p>Also of note, the Department of the Treasury conducted a pilot
  of the compliance review self-assessment checklist that had been drafted by the P/CL
  Subcommittee's Compliance Review Working Group in 2012. The
  objective of the pilot was to determine the effectiveness of this tool as a review
  and audit mechanism for agency compliance with their respective ISE privacy policies.
  Pursuant to the <em>ISE Privacy Guidelines</em>, federal agencies are
  required to have an adequate review and audit mechanism in place to verify compliance
  with the Guidelines. The results and recommendations from the pilot will be evaluated
  by the P/CL Subcommittee and used to enhance the efficacy of the
  checklist.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-4" id="section-4">Critical Role of the P/CL Official</a></h2>

  <p>As emphasized in previous annual reports, P/CL officials from
  federal ISE agencies must be actively involved with information sharing and
  safeguarding activities for their respective agencies. P/CL officials are charged
  with directly overseeing the implementation of, and compliance with, the <em>ISE
  Privacy Guidelines</em> and P/CR/CL policies and procedures within
  their agencies.</p>

  <p>ISE mission partners are actively working to ensure that legal
  and policy P/CR/CL requirements are appropriately and consistently integrated into
  programmatic activities. Full integration of P/CR/CL protections not only facilitate
  compliance with legal and policy requirements, but also ensure that mission needs are
  met.</p>

  <p>The responses to this year's performance
  assessment questionnaire indicate an increase in the involvement in ISE activities by
  P/CL officials, although the level of participation in ISE activities appears to be
  uneven across the agencies. Future progress can best be achieved by having P/CL
  officers work closely with operational stakeholders in the planning, development, and
  oversight of information sharing and safeguarding efforts, and by establishing a
  common understanding between and among mission partners on the need for and scope of
  these protections.</p>

  <p>In light of the National Strategy emphasis on streamlining the
  development process for information sharing agreements, P/CL officials are a critical
  resource for ISE agencies. P/CL officials must be involved early in the development
  process to ensure that mission-appropriate P/CR/CL protections are built into the
  agreements, and must be able to appropriately participate in reviews of compliance
  with the terms and conditions of information sharing agreements, including compliance
  with ISE requirements. For these reasons, ISE mission partners should assess whether
  their P/CL officials have the appropriate authority and resources needed to provide
  appropriate oversight over P/CR/CL issues that arise out of their
  agencies' participation in the ISE.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-5" id="section-5">Training and Outreach</a></h2>

  <p>Training and outreach are essential parts of P/CR/CL
  protections. Commitment to P/CR/CL safeguards builds trust with partners and the
  community, reinforces information sharing activities, and necessarily involves
  training personnel who are authorized to share protected information in the ISE. The
  National Strategy includes as a priority the need to provide training for information
  sharing, safeguarding, and handling to promote consistent, trusted processes. This
  training must address P/CR/CL legal and policy requirements, and must include
  role-based training where appropriate.</p>

  <p>At the federal level, mission partners have emphasized the
  importance of training ISE personnel on P/CR/CL protections, although the responses
  to the annual ISE Performance Assessment Questionnaire reveal that the types of
  training and the substantive depth of the modules differ from agency to agency. The
  types of training that were identified in the responses include privacy awareness and
  annual refresher training; ISE Core Awareness training available at <a href="http://www.ise.gov">ise.gov</a>; training on
  the agency's ISE privacy policy, including data handling,
  disclosure, redress, etc.; additional or specialized training developed by an agency
  or component privacy officer; specialized training on EO 12333, U.S. Intelligence Activities, and the application of dataset-specific
  requirements, including P/CR/CL protections; training that focuses specifically on
  civil liberties protections; and training on the sharing of protected information in
  the NSI.</p>

  <p>During this reporting cycle, the Department of the Interior
  (DOI) stands out for its efforts in developing a computer-based course entitled
  "<em>Privacy for the Information Sharing
  Environment</em>" that will provide guidance to all DOI
  law enforcement officials, as well as employees and contractors with ISE
  responsibilities, on compliance requirements for P/CR/CL protections. The module is
  expected to be completed in FY 2013.</p>

  <p>At the state and local level, training through various
  workshops and other presentations has helped to prevent the potential loss of
  institutional and subject matter knowledge resulting from the turnover in staff,
  liaison officers, and other fusion center personnel.</p>

  <p>
  <img width="108" height="108" src="assets/img/image092.png" alt="Title: Nashville - Description: Image of Nashville map." class="left"  />In November 2012 the DHS Office for Civil Rights and
Civil Liberties and the DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis hosted a National Fusion
Center Privacy, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties (P/CR/CL) Officer Workshop, in
coordination with the NSI PMO and the DOJ Bureau of Justice Assistance. Out of 78 fusion
center P/CR/CL Officers, 68, or roughly 87%, were present to hear about the latest P/CL
protection best practices and lessons learned. They were given a
"toolkit" with more than 15 P/CL training modules and
exercises for conducting further training at their centers.</p>

  <p>Fusion centers develop, implement, and enforce P/CR/CL
  safeguards to protect constitutional and other legal rights, and to ensure that they
  are addressing their legal and policy obligations while engaged in the fusion center
  process. Their commitment to these safeguards also builds trust with partners and the
  community, which in turn fosters increased information sharing, which is vital to
  executing the fusion process.</p>

  <p>The NSI has also continued to implement a comprehensive and
  multi-tiered approach to analyst/investigator training. This training, as with all
  NSI role-based training modules, emphasizes the importance of P/CR/CL protections in
  the process of identifying and documenting suspicious activity. The curriculum
  stresses, among other things, that reporting of suspicious activity must be based on
  one or more of the sixteen observed preoperational behaviors, and not be based solely
  on personal attributes such as race or ethnicity, or the
  individual's exercise of his or her civil liberties, which are
  protected by the Constitution.</p>

  <p>Outreach between ISE mission partners and with the advocacy
  community promotes transparency of ISE initiatives, and fosters an opportunity to
  assess public concerns and perceptions. Many federal and SLTT mission partners have
  established strong relationships with the advocacy community as part of their office
  or agency outreach program. Over the past eight years, PM-ISE's
  engagement with the advocacy community on ISE matters has resulted in stronger
  P/CR/CL protections in operational programs, training, and guidance materials. In May
  2013, PM-ISE hosted its fourth roundtable outreach event with the advocacy community,
  in collaboration with federal, state, and local mission partners.</p>

  <h2><a href="#section-6" id="section-6">Privacy, Civil Rights and Civil Liberties
  	- Next Steps</a></h2>

  <p>The ISA IPC Privacy and Civil Liberties (P/CL)
  Subcommittee has developed a series of next steps:</p>
  <ul>
  	<li><p> Develop and implement effective and comprehensive
  compliance, oversight, and accountability mechanisms for ensuring consistent
  application of mission-appropriate P/CR/CL protections by ISE mission partners.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Define and implement a common process and template for
  the development of information sharing agreements, to streamline the process and
  promote best practices.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Promote a common understanding of P/CR/CL protections
  across information exchanges of datasets, and other mission information through
  information sharing agreements.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Develop and implement ISE P/CR/CL training that can be
  leveraged by ISE mission partners.</p></li>
  	<li><p> Ensure a process for periodic outreach to the privacy,
  civil rights, and civil liberties advocacy community, to promote awareness and
  dialogue concerning developments across the ISE.</p></li>
